THE RETREAT.
</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">{1}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">1.</p>
Around her Father&rsquo;s neck the Maiden lock&rsquo;d<br/>
Her arms, when that portentous blow was given;<br/>
Clinging to him she heard the dread uproar,<br/>
And felt the shuddering shock which ran through Heaven.<br/>
Earth underneath them rock&rsquo;d,<br/>
Her strong foundations heaving in commotion,<br/>
Such as wild winds upraise in raving Ocean,<br/>
As though the solid base were rent asunder.<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{2}</span></p>
And lo! where, storming the astonish&rsquo;d sky,<br/>
Kehama and his evil host ascend!<br/>
Before them rolls the thunder,<br/>
Ten thousand thousand lightnings round them fly,<br/>
Upward the lengthening pageantries aspire,<br/>
Leaving from Earth to Heaven a widening wake of fire.<br/>

<p class="stanza">2.</p>
When the wild uproar was at length allay&rsquo;d,<br/>
And Earth, recovering from the shock, was still,<br/>
Thus to her father spake the imploring Maid.<br/>
Oh! by the love which we so long have borne<br/>
Each other, and we ne&rsquo;er shall cease to bear, . .<br/>
Oh! by the sufferings we have shar&rsquo;d,<br/>
And must not cease to share, . .<br/>
One boon I supplicate in this dread hour,<br/>
One consolation in this hour of woe!<br/>
Thou hast it in thy power, refuse not thou<br/>
The only comfort now<br/>
That my poor heart can know.<br/>

<p class="stanza">3.</p>
O dearest, dearest Kailyal! with a smile<br/>
Of tenderness and sorrow, he replied,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{3}</span></p>
O best belov&rsquo;d, and to be lov&rsquo;d the best<br/>
Best worthy, . . set thy duteous heart at rest.<br/>
I know thy wish, and let what will betide,<br/>
Ne&rsquo;er will I leave thee wilfully again.<br/>
My soul is strengthen&rsquo;d to endure its pain;<br/>
Be thou, in all my wanderings, still my guide;<br/>
Be thou, in all my sufferings, at my side.<br/>

<p class="stanza">4.</p>
The Maiden, at those welcome words, imprest<br/>
A passionate kiss upon her father&rsquo;s cheek:<br/>
They look&rsquo;d around them, then, as if to seek<br/>
Where they should turn, North, South, or East or West,<br/>
Wherever to their vagrant feet seem&rsquo;d best.<br/>
But, turning from the view her mournful eyes,<br/>
Oh, whither should we wander, Kailyal cries,<br/>
Or wherefore seek in vain a place of rest?<br/>
Have we not here the Earth beneath our tread,<br/>
Heaven overhead,<br/>
A brook that winds through this sequester&rsquo;d glade,<br/>
And yonder woods, to yield us fruit and shade!<br/>
The little all our wants require is nigh;<br/>
Hope we have none, . . why travel on in fear?<br/>
We cannot fly from Fate, and Fate will find us here.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{4}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">5.</p>
&rsquo;Twas a fair scene wherein they stood,<br/>
A green and sunny glade amid the wood,<br/>
And in the midst an aged Banian grew.<br/>
It was a goodly sight to see<br/>
That venerable tree,<br/>
For o&rsquo;er the lawn, irregularly spread,<br/>
Fifty straight columns propt its lofty head;<br/>
And many a long depending shoot,<br/>
Seeking to strike its root,<br/>
Straight like a plummet, grew towards the ground.<br/>
Some on the lower boughs, which crost their way,<br/>
Fixing their bearded fibres, round and round,<br/>
With many a ring and wild contortion wound;<br/>
Some to the passing wind at times, with sway<br/>
Of gentle motion swung,<br/>
Others of younger growth, unmov&rsquo;d, were hung<br/>
Like stone-drops from the cavern&rsquo;s fretted height.<br/>
Beneath was smooth and fair to sight,<br/>
Nor weeds nor briars deform&rsquo;d the natural floor,<br/>
And through the leafy cope which bower&rsquo;d it o&rsquo;er<br/>
Came gleams of checquered light.<br/>
So like a temple did it seem, that there<br/>
A pious heart&rsquo;s first impulse would be prayer.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{5}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">6.</p>
A brook, with easy current, murmured near;<br/>
Water so cool and clear<br/>
The peasants drink not from the humble well,<br/>
Which they with sacrifice of rural pride,<br/>
Have wedded to the cocoa-grove beside;<br/>
Nor tanks of costliest masonry dispense<br/>
To those in towns who dwell,<br/>
The work of Kings, in their beneficence.<br/>
Fed by perpetual springs, a small lagoon,<br/>
Pellucid, deep, and still, in silence join&rsquo;d<br/>
And swell&rsquo;d the passing stream. Like burnish&rsquo;d steel<br/>
Glowing, it lay beneath the eye of noon;<br/>
And when the breezes, in their play,<br/>
Ruffled the darkening surface, then, with gleam<br/>
Of sudden light, around the lotus stem<br/>
It rippled, and the sacred flowers that crown<br/>
The lakelet with their roseate beauty, ride,<br/>
In gentlest waving rock&rsquo;d, from side to side;<br/>
And as the wind upheaves<br/>
Their broad and buoyant weight, the glossy leaves<br/>
Flap on the twinkling waters, up and down.<br/>

<p class="stanza">7.</p>
They built them here a bower; of jointed cane,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{6}</span></p>
Strong for the needful use, and light and long<br/>
Was the slight frame-work rear&rsquo;d, with little pain;<br/>
Lithe creepers, then, the wicker-sides supply,<br/>
And the tall jungle-grass fit roofing gave<br/>
Beneath that genial sky.<br/>
And here did Kailyal, each returning day,<br/>
Pour forth libations from the brook, to pay<br/>
The Spirits of her Sires their grateful rite;<br/>
In such libations pour&rsquo;d in open glades,<br/>
Beside clear streams and solitary shades,<br/>
The Spirits of the virtuous dead delight.<br/>
And duly here, to Marriataly&rsquo;s praise,<br/>
The Maid, as with an Angel&rsquo;s voice of song,<br/>
Pour&rsquo;d her melodious lays<br/>
Upon the gales of even,<br/>
And gliding in religious dance along,<br/>
Mov&rsquo;d, graceful as the dark-eyed Nymphs of Heaven,<br/>
Such harmony to all her steps was given,<br/>

<p class="stanza">8.</p>
Thus ever, in her Father&rsquo;s doting eye,<br/>
Kailyal perform&rsquo;d the customary rite;<br/>
He, patient of his burning pain the while,<br/>
Beheld her, and approv&rsquo;d her pious toil;<br/>
And sometimes, at the sight,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{7}</span></p>
A melancholy smile<br/>
Would gleam upon his awful countenance,<br/>
He, too, by day and night, and every hour,<br/>
Paid to a higher Power his sacrifice;<br/>
An offering, not of ghee, or fruit, or rice,<br/>
Flower-crown, or blood; but of a heart subdued,<br/>
A resolute, unconquer&rsquo;d fortitude,<br/>
An agony represt, a will resign&rsquo;d,<br/>
To her, who, on her secret throne reclin&rsquo;d,<br/>
Amid the milky Sea, by Veeshnoo&rsquo;s side,<br/>
Looks with an eye of mercy on mankind.<br/>
By the Preserver, with his power endued,<br/>
There Voomdavee beholds this lower clime,<br/>
And marks the silent sufferings of the good,<br/>
To recompense them in her own good time.<br/>

<p class="stanza">9.</p>
O force of faith! O strength of virtuous will!<br/>
Behold him, in his endless martyrdom,<br/>
Triumphant still!<br/>
The Curse still burning in his heart and brain,<br/>
And yet doth he remain<br/>
Patient the while, and tranquil, and content!<br/>
The pious soul hath fram&rsquo;d unto itself<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{8}</span></p>
A second nature, to exist in pain<br/>
As in its own allotted element.<br/>

<p class="stanza">10.</p>
Such strength the will reveal&rsquo;d had given<br/>
This holy pair, such influxes of grace,<br/>
That to their solitary resting place<br/>
They brought the peace of Heaven.<br/>
Yea all around was hallowed! Danger, Fear,<br/>
Nor thought of evil ever entered here.<br/>
A charm was on the Leopard when he came<br/>
Within the circle of that mystic glade;<br/>
Submiss he crouch&rsquo;d before the heavenly maid,<br/>
And offered to her touch his speckled side;<br/>
Or with arch&rsquo;d back erect, and bending head,<br/>
And eyes half-clos&rsquo;d for pleasure, would he stand,<br/>
Courting the pressure of her gentle hand.<br/>

<p class="stanza">11.</p>
Trampling his path through wood and brake,<br/>
And canes which crackling fall before his way,<br/>
And tassel-grass, whose silvery feathers play<br/>
O&rsquo;ertopping the young trees,<br/>
On comes the Elephant, to slake<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{9}</span></p>
His thirst at noon in yon pellucid springs.<br/>
Lo! from his trunk upturn&rsquo;d, aloft he flings<br/>
The grateful shower; and now<br/>
Plucking the broad-leav&rsquo;d bough<br/>
Of yonder plane, with waving motion slow,<br/>
Fanning the languid air,<br/>
He moves it to and fro.<br/>
But when that form of beauty meets his sight,<br/>
The trunk its undulating motion stops,<br/>
From his forgetful hold the plane-branch drops,<br/>
Reverent he kneels, and lifts his rational eyes<br/>
To her as if in prayer;<br/>
And when she pours her angel voice in song,<br/>
Entranced he listens to the thrilling notes,<br/>
Till his strong temples, bath&rsquo;d with sudden dews,<br/>
Their fragrance of delight and love diffuse.<br/>

<p class="stanza">12.</p>
Lo! as the voice melodious floats around,<br/>
The Antelope draws near,<br/>
The Tygress leaves her toothless cubs to hear,<br/>
The Snake comes gliding from the secret brake,<br/>
Himself in fascination forced along<br/>
By that enchanting song;<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{10}</span></p>
The antic Monkies, whose wild gambols late,<br/>
When not a breeze wav&rsquo;d the tall jungle-grass,<br/>
Shook the whole wood, are hush&rsquo;d, and silently<br/>
Hang on the cluster&rsquo;d trees.<br/>
All things in wonder and delight are still;<br/>
Only at times the Nightingale is heard,<br/>
Not that in emulous skill that sweetest bird<br/>
Her rival strain would try,<br/>
A mighty songster, with the Maid to vie;<br/>
She only bore her part in powerful sympathy.<br/>

<p class="stanza">13.</p>
Well might they thus adore that heavenly Maid!<br/>
For never Nymph of Mountain,<br/>
Or Grove, or Lake, or Fountain,<br/>
With a diviner presence fill&rsquo;d the shade.<br/>
No idle ornaments deface<br/>
Her natural grace,<br/>
Musk-spot, nor sandal-streak, nor scarlet stain,<br/>
Ear-drop nor chain, nor arm nor ankle-ring,<br/>
Nor trinketry on front, or neck, or breast,<br/>
Marring the perfect form: she seem&rsquo;d a thing<br/>
Of Heaven&rsquo;s prime uncorrupted work, a child<br/>
Of early Nature undefil&rsquo;d,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{11}</span></p>
A daughter of the years of innocence.<br/>
And therefore all things lov&rsquo;d her. When she stood<br/>
Beside the glassy pool, the fish, that flies<br/>
Quick as an arrow from all other eyes,<br/>
Hover&rsquo;d to gaze on her. The mother bird,<br/>
When Kailyal&rsquo;s steps she heard,<br/>
Sought not to tempt her from her secret nest,<br/>
But, hastening to the dear retreat, would fly<br/>
To meet and welcome her benignant eye.<br/>

<p class="stanza">14.</p>
Hope we have none, said Kailyal to her Sire.<br/>
Said she aright? and had the Mortal Maid<br/>
No thoughts of heavenly aid, . .<br/>
No secret hopes her inmost heart to move<br/>
With longings of such deep and pure desire,<br/>
As vestal Maids, whose piety is love,<br/>
Feel in their extasies, when rapt above,<br/>
Their souls unto their heavenly Spouse aspire?<br/>
Why else so often doth that searching eye<br/>
Roam through the scope of sky?<br/>
Why, if she sees a distant speck on high,<br/>
Starts there that quick suffusion to her cheek?<br/>
&rsquo;Tis but the Eagle, in his heavenly height;<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{12}</span></p>
Reluctant to believe, she hears his cry,<br/>
And marks his wheeling flight,<br/>
Then languidly averts her mournful sight.<br/>
Why ever else, at morn, that waking sigh,<br/>
Because the lovely form no more is nigh<br/>
Which hath been present to her soul all night;<br/>
And that injurious fear<br/>
Which ever, as it riseth, is represt,<br/>
Yet riseth still within her troubled breast,<br/>
That she no more shall see the Glendoveer!<br/>

<p class="stanza">15.</p>
Hath he forgotten me? The wrongful thought<br/>
Would stir within her, and, though still repell&rsquo;d<br/>
With shame and self-reproaches, would recur.<br/>
Days after days unvarying come and go,<br/>
And neither friend nor foe<br/>
Approaches them in their sequestered bower.<br/>
Maid of strange destiny! but think not thou<br/>
Thou art forgotten now,<br/>
And hast no cause for farther hope or fear.<br/>
High-fated Maid, thou dost not know<br/>
What eyes watch over thee for weal and woe!<br/>
Even at this hour,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{13}</span></p>
Searching the dark decrees divine,<br/>
Kehama, in the fulness of his power,<br/>
Perceives his thread of fate entwin&rsquo;d with thine.<br/>
The Glendoveer, from his far sphere,<br/>
With love that never sleeps, beholds thee here,<br/>
And, in the hour permitted, will be near.<br/>
Dark Lorrinite on thee hath fix&rsquo;d her sight,<br/>
And laid her wiles, to aid<br/>
Foul Arvalan when he shall next appear;<br/>
For well she ween&rsquo;d his Spirit would renew<br/>
Old vengeance now, with unremitting hate;<br/>
The Enchantress well that evil nature knew,<br/>
The accursed Spirit hath his prey in view,<br/>
And thus, while all their separate hopes pursue,<br/>
All work, unconsciously, the will of Fate.<br/>

<p class="stanza">16.</p>
Fate work&rsquo;d its own the while. A band<br/>
Of Yoguees, as they roam&rsquo;d the land,<br/>
Seeking a spouse for Jaga-Naut their God,<br/>
Stray&rsquo;d to this solitary glade,<br/>
And reach&rsquo;d the bower wherein the Maid abode.<br/>
Wondering at form so fair, they deem&rsquo;d the power<br/>
Divine had led them to his chosen bride,<br/>
And seiz&rsquo;d and bore her from her father&rsquo;s side.<br/>


<h3 id="canto_14">
<br/><br/><br/>
XIV.<br/>
JAGA-NAUT.
</h3>

<p class="stanza">1.</p>
Joy in the city of great Jaga-Naut!<br/>
Joy in the seven-headed Idol&rsquo;s shrine!<br/>
A virgin-bride his ministers have brought,<br/>
A mortal maid, in form and face divine,<br/>
Peerless among all daughters of mankind;<br/>
Search&rsquo;d they the world again from East to West,<br/>
In endless quest,<br/>
Seeking the fairest and the best,<br/>
No maid so lovely might they hope to find; . .<br/>
For she hath breath&rsquo;d celestial air,<br/>
And heavenly food hath been her fare,<br/>
And heavenly thoughts and feelings give her face<br/>
That heavenly grace.<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{15}</span></p>
Joy in the city of great Jaga-Naut,<br/>
Joy in the seven-headed Idol&rsquo;s shrine!<br/>
The fairest Maid his Yoguees sought,<br/>
A fairer than the fairest have they brought,<br/>
A maid of charms surpassing human thought,<br/>
A maid divine.<br/>

<p class="stanza">2.</p>
Now bring ye forth the Chariot of the God!<br/>
Bring him abroad,<br/>
That through the swarming City he may ride;<br/>
And by his side<br/>
Place ye the Maid of more than mortal grace,<br/>
The Maid of perfect form and heavenly face!<br/>
Set her aloft in triumph, like a bride<br/>
Upon the bridal car,<br/>
And spread the joyful tidings wide and far, . .<br/>
Spread it with trump and voice<br/>
That all may hear, and all who hear rejoice, . .<br/>
The Mighty One hath found his mate! the God<br/>
Will ride abroad!<br/>
To-night will he go forth from his abode!<br/>
Ye myriads who adore him,<br/>
Prepare the way before him!<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{16}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">3.</p>
Uprear&rsquo;d on twenty wheels elate,<br/>
Huge as a Ship, the bridal car appear&rsquo;d;<br/>
Loud creak its ponderous wheels, as through the gate<br/>
A thousand Bramins drag the enormous load.<br/>
There, thron&rsquo;d aloft in state,<br/>
The image of the seven-headed God<br/>
Came forth from his abode; and at his side<br/>
Sate Kailyal like a bride;<br/>
A bridal statue rather might she seem,<br/>
For she regarded all things like a dream,<br/>
Having no thought, nor fear, nor will, nor aught<br/>
Save hope and faith, that liv&rsquo;d within her still.<br/>

<p class="stanza">4.</p>
O silent Night, how have they startled thee<br/>
With the brazen trumpet&rsquo;s blare!<br/>
And thou, O Moon! whose quiet light serene<br/>
Filleth wide heaven, and bathing hill and wood,<br/>
Spreads o&rsquo;er the peaceful valley like a flood,<br/>
How have they dimm&rsquo;d thee with the torches&rsquo; glare,<br/>
Which round yon moving pageant flame and flare,<br/>
As the wild rout, with deafening song and shout,<br/>
Fling their long flashes out,<br/>
That, like infernal lightnings, fire the air.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{17}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">5.</p>
A thousand pilgrims strain<br/>
Arm, shoulder, breast and thigh, with might and main,<br/>
To drag that sacred wain,<br/>
And scarce can draw along the enormous load.<br/>
Prone fall the frantic votaries in its road,<br/>
And, calling on the God,<br/>
Their self-devoted bodies there they lay<br/>
To pave his chariot-way.<br/>
On Jaga-Naut they call,<br/>
The ponderous Car rolls on, and crushes all.<br/>
Through blood and bones it ploughs its dreadful path.<br/>
Groans rise unheard; the dying cry,<br/>
And death and agony<br/>
Are trodden under foot by yon mad throng,<br/>
Who follow close, and thrust the deadly wheels along.<br/>

<p class="stanza">6.</p>
Pale grows the Maid at this accursed sight;<br/>
The yells which round her rise<br/>
Have rous&rsquo;d her with affright,<br/>
And fear hath given to her dilated eyes<br/>
A wilder light.<br/>
Where shall those eyes be turn&rsquo;d? she knows not where!<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{18}</span></p>
Downward they dare not look, for there<br/>
Is death and horror, and despair;<br/>
Nor can her patient looks to Heaven repair,<br/>
For the huge Idol over her, in air,<br/>
Spreads his seven hideous heads, and wide<br/>
Extends their snaky necks on every side;<br/>
And all around, behind, before,<br/>
The bridal Car, is the raging rout,<br/>
With frantic shout, and deafening roar,<br/>
Tossing the torches&rsquo; flames about.<br/>
And the double double peals of the drum are there,<br/>
And the startling burst of the trumpet&rsquo;s blare;<br/>
And the gong, that seems, with its thunders dread,<br/>
To stun the living, and waken the dead.<br/>
The ear-strings throb as if they were broke,<br/>
And the eye-lids drop at the weight of its stroke.<br/>
Fain would the Maid have kept them fast,<br/>
But open they start at the crack of the blast.<br/>

<p class="stanza">7.</p>
Where art thou, Son of Heaven, Ereenia! where<br/>
In this dread hour of horror and despair?<br/>
Thinking on him, she strove her fear to quell,<br/>
If he be near me, then will all be well;<br/>
And, if he reck not for my misery,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{19}</span></p>
Let come the worst, it matters not to me.<br/>
Repel that wrongful thought,<br/>
O Maid! thou feelest, but believ&rsquo;st it not;<br/>
It is thine own imperfect nature&rsquo;s fault<br/>
That lets one doubt of him arise within.<br/>
And this the Virgin knew; and, like a sin,<br/>
Repell&rsquo;d the thought, and still believ&rsquo;d him true;<br/>
And summoned up her spirit to endure<br/>
All forms of fear, in that firm trust secure.<br/>

<p class="stanza">8.</p>
She needs that faith, she needs that consolation,<br/>
For now the Car hath measured back its track<br/>
Of death, and hath re-entered now its station.<br/>
There, in the Temple-court, with song and dance,<br/>
A harlot-band, to meet the Maid, advance.<br/>
The drum hath ceas&rsquo;d its peals; the trump and gong<br/>
Are still; the frantic crowd forbear their yells;<br/>
And sweet it was to hear the voice of song,<br/>
And the sweet music of their girdle-bells,<br/>
Armlets and anklets, that, with chearful sounds<br/>
Symphonious tinkled as they wheel&rsquo;d around.<br/>

<p class="stanza">9.</p>
They sung a bridal measure,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{20}</span></p>
A song of pleasure,<br/>
A hymn of joyaunce and of gratulation.<br/>
Go, chosen One, they cried,<br/>
Go, happy bride!<br/>
For thee the God descends in expectation;<br/>
For thy dear sake<br/>
He leaves his heaven, O Maid of matchless charms.<br/>
Go, happy One, the bed divine partake,<br/>
And fill his longing arms!<br/>
Thus to the inner fane,<br/>
With circling dance and hymeneal strain,<br/>
The astonish&rsquo;d Maid they led,<br/>
And there they laid her on the bridal bed.<br/>
Then forth they went, and clos&rsquo;d the Temple-gate,<br/>
And left the wretched Kailyal to her fate.<br/>

<p class="stanza">10.</p>
Where art thou, Son of Heaven, Ereenia, where?<br/>
From the loathed bed she starts, and in the air<br/>
Looks up, as if she thought to find him there!<br/>
Then, in despair,<br/>
Anguish and agony, and hopeless prayer,<br/>
Prostrate she laid herself upon the floor.<br/>
There, trembling as she lay,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{21}</span></p>
The Bramin of the fane advanced<br/>
And came to seize his prey.<br/>

<p class="stanza">11.</p>
But as the Priest drew nigh,<br/>
A power invisible opposed his way;<br/>
Starting, he uttered wildly a death-cry,<br/>
And fell. At that the Maid all eagerly<br/>
Lifted in hope her head;<br/>
She thought her own deliverer had been near;<br/>
When lo! with other life re-animate,<br/>
She saw the dead arise,<br/>
And in the fiendish joy within his eyes,<br/>
She knew the hateful Spirit who look&rsquo;d through<br/>
Their specular orbs, . . cloth&rsquo;d in the flesh of man<br/>
She knew the accursed soul of Arvalan.<br/>

<p class="stanza">12.</p>
But not in vain, with the sudden shriek of fear,<br/>
She calls Ereenia now; the Glendoveer<br/>
Is here! Upon the guilty sight he burst<br/>
Like lightning from a cloud, and caught the accurst,<br/>
Bore him to the roof aloft, and on the floor<br/>
With vengeance dash&rsquo;d him, quivering there in gore.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{22}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">13.</p>
Lo! from the pregnant air, . . heart-withering sight!<br/>
There issued forth the dreadful Lorrinite,<br/>
Seize him! the Enchantress cried;<br/>
A host of Demons at her word appear,<br/>
And like tornado winds, from every side<br/>
At once, they rush upon the Glendoveer.<br/>
Alone against a legion, little here<br/>
Avails his single might,<br/>
Nor that celestial faulchion, which in fight<br/>
So oft had put the rebel race to flight.<br/>
There are no Gods on earth to give him aid;<br/>
Hemm&rsquo;d round, he is overpower&rsquo;d, beat down, and bound,<br/>
And at the feet of Lorrinite is laid.<br/>

<p class="stanza">14.</p>
Meantime the scattered members of the slain,<br/>
Obedient to her mighty voice, assum&rsquo;d<br/>
Their vital form again,<br/>
And that foul Spirit, upon vengeance bent,<br/>
Fled to the fleshly tenement.<br/>
Lo! here, quoth Lorrinite, thou seest thy foe!<br/>
Him in the Ancient Sepulchres, below<br/>
The billows of the Ocean, will I lay;<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{23}</span></p>
Gods are there none to help him now, and there<br/>
For Man there is no way.<br/>
To that dread scene of durance and despair,<br/>
Asuras, bear your enemy! I go<br/>
To chain him in the Tombs. Meantime do thou,<br/>
Freed from thy foe, and now secure from fear,<br/>
Son of Kehama, take thy pleasure here.<br/>

<p class="stanza">15.</p>
Her words the accursed race obey&rsquo;d;<br/>
Forth with a sound like rushing winds they fled,<br/>
And of all aid from Earth or Heaven bereft,<br/>
Alone with Arvalan the Maid was left.<br/>
But in that hour of agony, the Maid<br/>
Deserted not herself; her very dread<br/>
Had calm&rsquo;d her; and her heart<br/>
Knew the whole horror, and its only part.<br/>
Yamen, receive me undefil&rsquo;d! she said,<br/>
And seiz&rsquo;d a torch, and fir&rsquo;d the bridal bed.<br/>
Up ran the rapid flames; on every side<br/>
They find their fuel wheresoe&rsquo;er they spread,<br/>
Thin hangings, fragrant gums, and odorous wood,<br/>
That pil&rsquo;d like sacrificial altars stood.<br/>
Around they run, and upward they aspire,<br/>
And, lo! the huge Pagoda lin&rsquo;d with fire.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{24}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">16.</p>
The wicked Soul, who had assum&rsquo;d again<br/>
A form of sensible flesh, for his foul will,<br/>
Still bent on base revenge, and baffled still,<br/>
Felt that corporeal shape alike to pain<br/>
Obnoxious as to pleasure; forth he flew,<br/>
Howling and scorch&rsquo;d by the devouring flame;<br/>
Accursed Spirit! still condemn&rsquo;d to rue,<br/>
The act of sin and punishment the same.<br/>
Freed from his loathsome touch, a natural dread<br/>
Came on the self-devoted, and she drew<br/>
Back from the flames, which now toward her spread,<br/>
And, like a living monster, seem&rsquo;d to dart<br/>
Their hungry tongues toward their shrinking prey.<br/>
Soon she subdued her heart;<br/>
O Father! she exclaim&rsquo;d, there was no way<br/>
But this! and thou, Ereenia, who for me<br/>
Sufferest, my soul shall bear thee company.<br/>

<p class="stanza">17.</p>
So having said, she knit<br/>
Her body up to work her soul&rsquo;s desire,<br/>
And rush at once amid the thickest fire.<br/>
A sudden cry withheld her, . . Kailyal, stay!<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{25}</span></p>
Child! Daughter! I am here! the voice exclaims,<br/>
And from the gate, unharm&rsquo;d, through smoke and flames<br/>
Like as a God, Ladurlad made his way;<br/>
Wrapt his preserving arms around, and bore<br/>
His Child, uninjur&rsquo;d, o&rsquo;er the burning floor.<br/>

<p class="spk">Kailyal.</p>
Ereenia!<br/>

<p class="spk">Ladurlad.</p>
Nay, let no reproachful thought<br/>
Wrong his heroic heart! The Evil Powers<br/>
Have the dominion o&rsquo;er this wretched World,<br/>
And no good Spirit now can venture here.<br/>

<p class="spk">Kailyal.</p>
Alas, my Father! he hath ventur&rsquo;d here,<br/>
And sav&rsquo;d me from one horror. But the Powers<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{27}</span></p>
Of Evil beat him down, and bore away<br/>
To some dread scene of durance and despair,<br/>
The Ancient Tombs, methought their Mistress said,<br/>
Beneath the ocean-waves: no way for Man<br/>
Is there; and Gods, she boasted, there are none<br/>
On Earth to help him now.<br/>

<p class="spk">Ladurlad.</p>
Is that her boast?<br/>
And hath she laid him in the Ancient Tombs,<br/>
Relying that the Waves will guard him there?<br/>
Short-sighted are the eyes of Wickedness,<br/>
And all its craft but folly. O, my child!<br/>
The Curses of the Wicked are upon me,<br/>
And the immortal Deities, who see<br/>
And suffer all things for their own wise end,<br/>
Have made them blessings to us!<br/>

Where they have borne him?<br/>

<p class="spk">Ladurlad.</p>
To the Sepulchres<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{28}</span></p>
Of the Ancient Kings, which Baly, in his power,<br/>
Made in primeval times; and built above them<br/>
A City, like the Cities of the Gods,<br/>
Being like a God himself. For many an age<br/>
Hath Ocean warr&rsquo;d against his Palaces,<br/>
Till overwhelm&rsquo;d, they lie beneath the waves,<br/>
Not overthrown, so well the Mighty One<br/>
Had laid their deep foundations. Rightly said<br/>
The Accursed, that no way for Man was there,<br/>
But not like Man am I!<br/>

<p class="stanza">1.</p>
Up from the ground the Maid exultant sprung,<br/>
And clapp&rsquo;d her happy hands, in attitude<br/>
Of thanks, to Heaven, and flung<br/>
Her arms around her Father&rsquo;s neck, and stood<br/>
Struggling awhile for utterance, with excess<br/>
Of hope and pious thankfulness.<br/>
Come . . come! she cried, O let us not delay, . .<br/>
He is in torments there, . . away! . . away!<br/>

<p class="stanza">2.</p>
Long time they travell&rsquo;d on; at dawn of day<br/>
Still setting forward with the earliest light,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{29}</span></p>
Nor ceasing from their way<br/>
Till darkness clos&rsquo;d the night.<br/>
Short refuge from the noontide heat,<br/>
Reluctantly compell&rsquo;d, the Maiden took;<br/>
And ill her indefatigable feet<br/>
Could that brief tarriance brook.<br/>
Hope kept her up, and her intense desire<br/>
Supports that heart which ne&rsquo;er at danger quails,<br/>
Those feet which never tire,<br/>
That frame which never fails.<br/>

<p class="stanza">3.</p>
Their talk was of the City of the days<br/>
Of old, Earth&rsquo;s wonder once; and of the fame<br/>
Of Baly its great founder, . . he whose name<br/>
In ancient story, and in poet&rsquo;s praise,<br/>
Liveth and flourisheth for endless glory,<br/>
Because his might<br/>
Put down the wrong, and aye upheld the right.<br/>
Till for ambition, as old sages tell,<br/>
The mighty Monarch fell:<br/>
For he too, having made the World his own,<br/>
Then, in his pride, had driven<br/>
The Devetas from Heaven,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{30}</span></p>
And seiz&rsquo;d triumphantly the Swerga throne.<br/>
The Incarnate came before the Mighty One,<br/>
In dwarfish stature, and in mien obscure;<br/>
The sacred cord he bore,<br/>
And ask&rsquo;d, for Brama&rsquo;s sake, a little boon,<br/>
Three steps of Baly&rsquo;s ample reign, no more.<br/>
Poor was the boon requir&rsquo;d, and poor was he<br/>
Who begg&rsquo;d, . . a little wretch it seem&rsquo;d to be;<br/>
But Baly ne&rsquo;er refus&rsquo;d a suppliant&rsquo;s prayer.<br/>
A glance of pity, in contemptuous mood,<br/>
He on the Dwarf cast down,<br/>
And bade him take the boon,<br/>
And measure where he would.<br/>

<p class="stanza">4.</p>
Lo, Son of giant birth,<br/>
I take my grant! the Incarnate power replies.<br/>
With his first step he measur&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the Earth,<br/>
The second spann&rsquo;d the skies.<br/>
Three paces thou hast granted,<br/>
Twice have I set my footstep, Veeshnoo cries,<br/>
Where shall the third be planted?<br/>

<p class="stanza">5.</p>
Then Baly knew the God, and at his feet,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{31}</span></p>
In homage due, he laid his humbled head.<br/>
Mighty art thou, O Lord of Earth and Heaven,<br/>
Mighty art thou! he said,<br/>
Be merciful, and let me be forgiven.<br/>
He ask&rsquo;d for mercy of the merciful,<br/>
And mercy for his virtue&rsquo;s sake was shown.<br/>
For though he was cast down to Padalon,<br/>
Yet there, by Yamen&rsquo;s throne,<br/>
Doth Baly sit in majesty and might,<br/>
To judge the dead, and sentence them aright.<br/>
And forasmuch as he was still the friend<br/>
Of righteousness, it is permitted him,<br/>
Yearly, from those drear regions to ascend,<br/>
And walk the Earth, that he may hear his name<br/>
Still hymn&rsquo;d and honour&rsquo;d, by the grateful voice<br/>
Of humankind, and in his fame rejoice.<br/>

<p class="stanza">6.</p>
Such was the talk they held upon their way,<br/>
Of him to whose old City they were bound;<br/>
And now, upon their journey, many a day<br/>
Had risen and clos&rsquo;d, and many a week gone round,<br/>
And many a realm and region had they past,<br/>
When now the Ancient Towers appear&rsquo;d at last.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{32}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">7.</p>
Their golden summits, in the noon-day light,<br/>
Shone o&rsquo;er the dark-green deep that roll&rsquo;d between;<br/>
For domes, and pinnacles, and spires were seen<br/>
Peering above the sea, . . a mournful sight!<br/>
Well might the sad beholder ween from thence<br/>
What works of wonder the devouring wave<br/>
Had swallowed there, when monuments so brave<br/>
Bore record of their old magnificence.<br/>
And on the sandy shore, beside the verge<br/>
Of Ocean, here and there, a rock-hewn fane<br/>
Resisted in its strength the surf and surge<br/>
That on their deep foundations beat in vain.<br/>
In solitude the Ancient Temples stood,<br/>
Once resonant with instrument and song,<br/>
And solemn dance of festive multitude;<br/>
Now as the weary ages pass along,<br/>
No voice they hear, save of the Ocean flood,<br/>
Which roars for ever on the restless shores;<br/>
Or, visiting their solitary caves,<br/>
The lonely sound of Winds, that moan around<br/>
Accordant to the melancholy waves.<br/>

<p class="stanza">8.</p>
With reverence did the travellers see<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{33}</span></p>
The works of ancient days, and silently<br/>
Approach the shore. Now on the yellow sand,<br/>
Where round their feet the rising surges part,<br/>
They stand. Ladurlad&rsquo;s heart<br/>
Exulted in his wonderous destiny.<br/>
To Heaven he rais&rsquo;d his hand<br/>
In attitude of stern heroic pride;<br/>
Oh what a power, he cried,<br/>
Thou dreadful Rajah, doth thy Curse impart!<br/>
I thank thee now! . . Then turning to the Maid,<br/>
Thou see&rsquo;st how far and wide<br/>
Yon Towers extend, he said,<br/>
My search must needs be long. Meantime the flood<br/>
Will cast thee up thy food, . .<br/>
And in the Chambers of the Rock by night,<br/>
Take thou thy safe abode,<br/>
No prowling beast to harm thee, or affright,<br/>
Can enter there; but wrap thyself with care<br/>
From the foul Bird obscene that thirsts for blood;<br/>
For in such caverns doth the Bat delight<br/>
To have its haunts. Do thou with stone and shout,<br/>
Ere thou liest down at evening, scare them out,<br/>
And in this robe of mine involve thy feet.<br/>
Duly commend us both to Heaven in prayer,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{34}</span></p>
Be of good heart, and let thy sleep be sweet.<br/>

<p class="stanza">9.</p>
So saying, he put back his arm, and gave<br/>
The cloth which girt his loins, and prest her hand<br/>
With fervent love, then down the sloping sand<br/>
Advanced into the sea: the coming Wave,<br/>
Which knew Kehama&rsquo;s Curse, before his way<br/>
Started, and on he went as on dry land,<br/>
And still around his path the waters parted.<br/>
She stands upon the shore, where sea-weeds play,<br/>
Lashing her polish&rsquo;d ankles, and the spray<br/>
Which off her Father, like a rainbow, fled,<br/>
Falls on her like a shower; there Kailyal stands,<br/>
And sees the billows rise above his head.<br/>
She, at the startling sight, forgot the power<br/>
The Curse had given him, and held forth her hands<br/>
Imploringly, . . . her voice was on the wind,<br/>
And the deaf Ocean o&rsquo;er Ladurlad clos&rsquo;d.<br/>
Soon she recall&rsquo;d his destiny to mind,<br/>
And, shaking off that natural fear, compos&rsquo;d<br/>
Her soul with prayer, to wait the event resign&rsquo;d.<br/>

<p class="stanza">10.</p>
Alone, upon the solitary strand,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{35}</span></p>
The lovely one is left; behold her go,<br/>
Pacing with patient footsteps, to and fro,<br/>
Along the bending sand.<br/>
Save her, ye Gods! from Evil Powers, and here<br/>
From man she need not fear;<br/>
For never Traveller comes near<br/>
These awful ruins of the days of yore,<br/>
Nor fisher&rsquo;s bark, nor venturous mariner,<br/>
Approach the sacred shore.<br/>
All day she walk&rsquo;d the beach, at night she sought<br/>
The Chamber of the Rock; with stone and shout<br/>
Assail&rsquo;d the Bats obscene, and scar&rsquo;d them out;<br/>
Then in her Father&rsquo;s robe involv&rsquo;d her feet,<br/>
And wrapt her mantle round to guard her head,<br/>
And laid her down: the rock was Kailyal&rsquo;s bed,<br/>
Her chamber-lamps were in the starry sky,<br/>
The winds and waters were her lullaby.<br/>

<p class="stanza">11.</p>
Be of good heart, and let thy sleep be sweet,<br/>
Ladurlad said, . . Alas! that cannot be<br/>
To one whose days are days of misery.<br/>
How often did she stretch her hands to greet<br/>
Ereenia, rescued in the dreams of night!<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{36}</span></p>
How oft amid the vision of delight,<br/>
Fear in her heart all is not as it seems;<br/>
Then from unsettled slumber start, and hear<br/>
The Winds that moan above, the Waves below!<br/>
Thou hast been call&rsquo;d, O Sleep! the friend of Woe,<br/>
But &rsquo;tis the happy who have call&rsquo;d thee so.<br/>

<p class="stanza">12.</p>
Another day, another night are gone,<br/>
A second passes, and a third wanes on.<br/>
So long she paced the shore,<br/>
So often on the beach she took her stand,<br/>
That the wild Sea-Birds knew her, and no more<br/>
Fled, when she past beside them on the strand.<br/>
Bright shine the golden summits in the light<br/>
Of the noon-sun, and lovelier far by night<br/>
Their moonlight glories o&rsquo;er the sea they shed:<br/>
Fair is the dark-green deep; by night and day<br/>
Unvex&rsquo;d with storms, the peaceful billows play,<br/>
As when they clos&rsquo;d upon Ladurlad&rsquo;s head:<br/>
The firmament above is bright and clear;<br/>
The sea-fowl, lords of water, air, and land,<br/>
Joyous alike upon the wing appear,<br/>
Or when they ride the waves, or walk the sand;<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{37}</span></p>
Beauty and light and joy are every-where;<br/>
There is no sadness and no sorrow here,<br/>
Save what that single human breast contains,<br/>
But oh! what hopes, and fears, and pains are there!<br/>

<p class="stanza">13.</p>
Seven miserable days the expectant Maid,<br/>
From earliest dawn till evening, watch&rsquo;d the shore;<br/>
Hope left her then; and in her heart she said,<br/>
Never shall I behold my Father more!<br/>

THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.
</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">{38}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">1.</p>
When the broad Ocean on Ladurlad&rsquo;s head<br/>
Had clos&rsquo;d and arch&rsquo;d him o&rsquo;er,<br/>
With steady tread he held his way<br/>
Adown the sloping shore.<br/>
The dark-green waves, with emerald hue,<br/>
Imbue the beams of day,<br/>
And on the wrinkled sand below,<br/>
Rolling their mazy network to and fro,<br/>
Light shadows shift and play.<br/>
The hungry Shark, at scent of prey,<br/>
Toward Ladurlad darted;<br/>
Beholding then that human form erect,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{39}</span></p>
How like a God the depths he trod,<br/>
Appall&rsquo;d the monster started,<br/>
And in his fear departed.<br/>
Onward Ladurlad went with heart elate,<br/>
And now hath reach&rsquo;d the Ancient City&rsquo;s gate.<br/>

<p class="stanza">2.</p>
Wondering, he stood awhile to gaze<br/>
Upon the works of elder days.<br/>
The brazen portals open stood,<br/>
Even as the fearful multitude<br/>
Had left them, when they fled<br/>
Before the rising flood.<br/>
High over-head, sublime,<br/>
The mighty gateway&rsquo;s storied roof was spread,<br/>
Dwarfing the puny piles of younger time.<br/>
With the deeds of days of yore<br/>
That ample roof was sculptur&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er,<br/>
And many a godlike form there met his eye,<br/>
And many an emblem dark of mystery.<br/>
Through these wide portals oft had Baly rode<br/>
Triumphant from his proud abode,<br/>
When, in his greatness, he bestrode<br/>
The Aullay, hugest of four-footed kind,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{40}</span></p>
The Aullay-Horse, that in his force,<br/>
With elephantine trunk, could bind<br/>
And lift the elephant, and on the wind<br/>
Whirl him away, with sway and swing,<br/>
Even like a pebble from the practis&rsquo;d sling.<br/>

<p class="stanza">3.</p>
Those streets which never, since the days of yore,<br/>
By human footstep had been visited;<br/>
Those streets; which never more<br/>
A human foot shall tread,<br/>
Ladurlad trod. In sun-light, and sea-green,<br/>
The thousand palaces were seen<br/>
Of that proud city, whose superb abodes<br/>
Seem&rsquo;d rear&rsquo;d by Giants for the immortal Gods.<br/>
How silent and how beautiful they stand,<br/>
Like things of Nature! the eternal rocks<br/>
Themselves not firmer. Neither hath the sand<br/>
Drifted within their gates, and choak&rsquo;d their doors,<br/>
Nor slime defil&rsquo;d their pavements and their floors.<br/>
Did then the Ocean wage<br/>
His war for love and envy, not in rage,<br/>
O thou fair City, that he spares thee thus?<br/>
Art thou Varounin&rsquo;s capital and court,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{41}</span></p>
Where all the Sea-Gods for delight resort,<br/>
A place too godlike to be held by us,<br/>
The poor degenerate children of the Earth?<br/>
So thought Ladurlad, as he look&rsquo;d around,<br/>
Weening to hear the sound<br/>
Of Mermaid&rsquo;s shell, and song<br/>
Of choral throng from some imperial hall,<br/>
Wherein the Immortal Powers, at festival,<br/>
Their high carousals keep.<br/>
But all is silence dread,<br/>
Silence profound and dead,<br/>
The everlasting stillness of the Deep.<br/>

<p class="stanza">4.</p>
Through many a solitary street,<br/>
And silent market-place, and lonely square,<br/>
Arm&rsquo;d with the mighty Curse, behold him fare.<br/>
And now his feet attain that royal fane<br/>
Where Baly held of old his awful reign.<br/>
What once had been the Garden spread around,<br/>
Fair Gardens, once which wore perpetual green,<br/>
Where all sweet flowers through all the year were found,<br/>
And all fair fruits were through all seasons seen;<br/>
A place of Paradise, where each device<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{42}</span></p>
Of emulous Art with Nature strove to vie;<br/>
And Nature, on her part,<br/>
Call&rsquo;d forth new powers wherewith to vanquish Art.<br/>
The Swerga-God himself, with envious eye,<br/>
Survey&rsquo;d those peerless gardens in their prime;<br/>
Nor ever did the Lord of Light,<br/>
Who circles Earth and Heaven upon his way,<br/>
Behold from eldest time a goodlier sight<br/>
Than were the groves which Baly, in his might,<br/>
Made for his chosen place of solace and delight.<br/>

<p class="stanza">5.</p>
It was a Garden still beyond all price,<br/>
Even yet it was a place of Paradise;<br/>
For where the mighty Ocean could not spare,<br/>
There had he, with his own creation,<br/>
Sought to repair his work of devastation.<br/>
And here were coral bowers,<br/>
And grots of madrepores,<br/>
And banks of spunge, as soft and fair to eye<br/>
As e&rsquo;er was mossy bed<br/>
Whereon the Wood Nymphs lie<br/>
With languid limbs in summer&rsquo;s sultry hours.<br/>
Here, too, were living flowers<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{43}</span></p>
Which, like a bud compacted,<br/>
Their purple cups contracted,<br/>
And now in open blossom spread,<br/>
Stretch&rsquo;d like green anthers many a seeking head.<br/>
And arborets of jointed stone were there,<br/>
And plants of fibres fine, as silkworm&rsquo;s thread;<br/>
Yea, beautiful as Mermaid&rsquo;s golden hair<br/>
Upon the waves dispread:<br/>
Others that, like the broad banana growing,<br/>
Rais&rsquo;d their long wrinkled leaves of purple hue,<br/>
Like streamers wide out-flowing.<br/>
And whatsoe&rsquo;er the depths of Ocean hide<br/>
From human eyes, Ladurlad there espied,<br/>
Trees of the deep, and shrubs and fruits and flowers,<br/>
As fair as ours,<br/>
Wherewith the Sea-Nymphs love their locks to braid,<br/>
When to their father&rsquo;s hall, at festival<br/>
Repairing, they, in emulous array,<br/>
Their charms display,<br/>
To grace the banquet, and the solemn day.<br/>

<p class="stanza">6.</p>
The golden fountains had not ceas&rsquo;d to flow,<br/>
And, where they mingled with the briny Sea,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{44}</span></p>
There was a sight of wonder and delight,<br/>
To see the fish, like birds in air,<br/>
Above Ladurlad flying.<br/>
Round those strange waters they repair,<br/>
Their scarlet fins outspread and plying,<br/>
They float with gentle hovering there;<br/>
And now upon those little wings,<br/>
As if to dare forbidden things,<br/>
With wilful purpose bent,<br/>
Swift as an arrow from a bow<br/>
They dash across, and to and fro,<br/>
In rapid glance, like lightning go<br/>
Through that unwonted element.<br/>
Almost in scenes so wonderous fair,<br/>
Ladurlad had forgot<br/>
The mighty cause which led him there;<br/>
His busy eye was every where,<br/>
His mind had lost all thought;<br/>
His heart, surrendered to the joys<br/>
Of sight, was happy as a boy&rsquo;s.<br/>
But soon the awakening thought recurs<br/>
Of him who, in the Sepulchres,<br/>
Hopeless of human aid, in chains is laid;<br/>
And her who, on the solitary shore,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{45}</span></p>
By night and day her weary watch will keep,<br/>
Till she shall see them issuing from the deep.<br/>

<p class="stanza">7.</p>
Now hath Ladurlad reach&rsquo;d the Court<br/>
Of the great Palace of the King; its floor<br/>
Was of the marble rock; and there before<br/>
The imperial door,<br/>
A mighty Image on the steps was seen,<br/>
Of stature huge, of countenance serene.<br/>
A crown and sceptre at his feet were laid;<br/>
One hand a scroll display&rsquo;d,<br/>
The other pointed there, that all might see;<br/>
My name is Death, it said,<br/>
In mercy have the Gods appointed me.<br/>
Two brazen gates beneath him, night and day<br/>
Stood open; and within them you behold<br/>
Descending steps, which in the living stone<br/>
Were hewn, a spacious way<br/>
Down to the Chambers of the Kings of old.<br/>

<p class="stanza">8.</p>
Trembling with hope, the adventurous man descended<br/>
The sea-green light of day<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{46}</span></p>
Not far along the vault extended;<br/>
But where the slant reflection ended,<br/>
Another light was seen<br/>
Of red and fiery hue,<br/>
That with the water blended,<br/>
And gave the secrets of the Tombs to view.<br/>

<p class="stanza">9.</p>
Deep in the marble rock, the Hall<br/>
Of Death was hollowed out, a chamber wide,<br/>
Low-roof&rsquo;d, and long; on either side,<br/>
Each in his own alcove, and on his throne,<br/>
The Kings of old were seated: in his hand<br/>
Each held the sceptre of command,<br/>
From whence, across that scene of endless night,<br/>
A carbuncle diffused its everlasting light.<br/>

<p class="stanza">10.</p>
So well had the embalmers done their part<br/>
With spice and precious unguents, to imbue<br/>
The perfect corpse, that each had still the hue<br/>
Of living man, and every limb was still<br/>
Supple and firm and full, as when of yore<br/>
Its motion answered to the moving will.<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{47}</span></p>
The robes of royalty which once they wore,<br/>
Long since had mouldered off and left them bare:<br/>
Naked upon their thrones behold them there,<br/>
Statues of actual flesh, . . a fearful sight!<br/>
Their large and rayless eyes<br/>
Dimly reflecting to that gem-born light,<br/>
Glaz&rsquo;d, fix&rsquo;d, and meaningless, . . . yet, open wide,<br/>
Their ghastly balls belied<br/>
The mockery of life in all beside.<br/>

<p class="stanza">11.</p>
But if, amid these Chambers drear,<br/>
Death were a sight of shuddering and of fear,<br/>
Life was a thing of stranger horror here.<br/>
For at the farther end, in yon alcove,<br/>
Where Baly should have lain, had he obey&rsquo;d<br/>
Man&rsquo;s common lot, behold Ereenia laid.<br/>
Strong fetters link him to the rock; his eye<br/>
Now rolls and widens, as with effort vain<br/>
He strives to break the chain,<br/>
Now seems to brood upon his misery.<br/>
Before him couch&rsquo;d there lay<br/>
One of the mighty monsters of the deep,<br/>
Whom Lorrinite encountering on the way,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{48}</span></p>
There station&rsquo;d, his perpetual guard to keep;<br/>
In the sport of wanton power, she charm&rsquo;d him there,<br/>
As if to mock the Glendoveer&rsquo;s despair.<br/>
Upward his form was human, save that here<br/>
The skin was cover&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er with scale on scale<br/>
Compact, a panoply of natural mail.<br/>
His mouth, from ear to ear,<br/>
Weapon&rsquo;d with triple teeth, extended wide,<br/>
And tusks on either side;<br/>
A double snake below, he roll&rsquo;d<br/>
His supple lengths behind in many a sinuous fold.<br/>

<p class="stanza">12.</p>
With red and kindling eye, the Beast beholds<br/>
A living man draw nigh,<br/>
And, rising on his folds,<br/>
In hungry joy awaits the expected feast,<br/>
His mouth half-open, and his teeth unsheath&rsquo;d.<br/>
Then on he sprung, and in his scaly arms<br/>
Seiz&rsquo;d him, and fasten&rsquo;d on his neck, to suck,<br/>
With greedy lips, the warm life-blood: and sure<br/>
But for the mighty power of magic charms,<br/>
As easily as, in the blithesome hour<br/>
Of spring, a child doth crop the meadow flower,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{49}</span></p>
Piecemeal those claws<br/>
Had rent their victim, and those armed jaws<br/>
Snapt him in twain. Naked Ladurlad stood,<br/>
Yet fearless and unharm&rsquo;d in this dread strife,<br/>
So well Kehama&rsquo;s Curse had charm&rsquo;d his fated life.<br/>

<p class="stanza">13.</p>
He too, . . . for anger, rising at the sight<br/>
Of him he sought, in such strange thrall confin&rsquo;d.<br/>
With desperate courage fir&rsquo;d Ladurlad&rsquo;s mind, . . .<br/>
He, too, unto the fight himself addrest,<br/>
And grappling breast to breast,<br/>
With foot firm-planted stands,<br/>
And seiz&rsquo;d the monster&rsquo;s throat with both his hands.<br/>
Vainly, with throttling grasp, he prest<br/>
The impenetrable scales;<br/>
And lo! the guard rose up, and round his foe,<br/>
With gliding motion, wreath&rsquo;d his lengthening coils,<br/>
Then tighten&rsquo;d all their folds with stress and strain.<br/>
Nought would the raging Tyger&rsquo;s strength avail<br/>
If once involv&rsquo;d within those mighty toils;<br/>
The arm&rsquo;d Rhinoceros, so clasp&rsquo;d, in vain<br/>
Had trusted to his hide of rugged mail,<br/>
His bones all broken, and the breath of life<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{50}</span></p>
Crush&rsquo;d from the lungs, in that unequal strife.<br/>
Again, and yet again, he sought to break<br/>
The impassive limbs; but when the monster found<br/>
His utmost power was vain,<br/>
A moment he relax&rsquo;d in every round,<br/>
Then knit his coils again with closer strain,<br/>
And, bearing forward, forced him to the ground.<br/>

<p class="stanza">14.</p>
Ereenia groan&rsquo;d in anguish at the sight<br/>
Of this dread fight: once more the Glendoveer<br/>
Essay&rsquo;d to break his bonds, and fear<br/>
For that brave spirit who had sought him here,<br/>
Stung him to wilder strugglings. From the rock<br/>
He rais&rsquo;d himself half up, . . with might and main<br/>
Pluck&rsquo;d at the adamantine chain;<br/>
And now, with long and unrelaxing strain,<br/>
In obstinate effort of indignant strength,<br/>
Labour&rsquo;d and strove in vain;<br/>
Till his immortal sinews fail&rsquo;d at length;<br/>
And yielding, with an inward groan, to fate,<br/>
Despairingly, he let himself again<br/>
Fall prostrate on his prison-bed of stone,<br/>
Body and chain alike with lifeless weight.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{51}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">15.</p>
Struggling they lay in mortal fray<br/>
All day, while day was in our upper sphere,<br/>
For light of day,<br/>
And natural darkness never entered here;<br/>
All night, with unabated might,<br/>
They waged the unremitting fight.<br/>
A second day, a second night,<br/>
With furious will they wrestled still.<br/>
The third came on, the fourth is gone;<br/>
Another comes, another goes,<br/>
And yet no respite, no repose;<br/>
But day and night, and night and day,<br/>
Involv&rsquo;d in mortal strife they lay;<br/>
Six days and nights have past away,<br/>
And still they wage, with mutual rage,<br/>
The unremitting fray.<br/>
With mutual rage their war they wage,<br/>
But not with mutual will;<br/>
For when the seventh morning came,<br/>
The monster&rsquo;s worn and wearied frame<br/>
In this strange contest fails;<br/>
And weaker, weaker, every hour<br/>
He yields beneath strong Nature&rsquo;s power,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{52}</span></p>
For now the Curse prevails.<br/>

<p class="stanza">16.</p>
Sometimes the Beast sprung up to bear<br/>
His foe aloft; and, trusting there<br/>
To shake him from his hold,<br/>
Relax&rsquo;d the rings that wreath&rsquo;d him round;<br/>
But on his throat Ladurlad hung,<br/>
And weigh&rsquo;d him to the ground;<br/>
And if they sink, or if they float,<br/>
Alike with stubborn clasp he clung,<br/>
Tenacious of his grasp;<br/>
For well he knew with what a power,<br/>
Exempt from Nature&rsquo;s laws,<br/>
The Curse had arm&rsquo;d him for this hour;<br/>
And in the monster&rsquo;s gasping jaws,<br/>
And in his hollow eye,<br/>
Well could Ladurlad now descry<br/>
The certain signs of victory.<br/>

<p class="stanza">17.</p>
And now the guard no more can keep<br/>
His painful watch; his eyes, opprest,<br/>
Are fainting for their natural sleep;<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{53}</span></p>
His living flesh and blood must rest,<br/>
The Beast must sleep or die.<br/>
Then he, full faint and languidly,<br/>
Unwreathes his rings and strives to fly,<br/>
And still retreating, slowly trails<br/>
His stiff and heavy length of scales.<br/>
But that unweariable foe,<br/>
With will relentless, follows still;<br/>
No breathing time, no pause of fight<br/>
He gives, but presses on his flight;<br/>
Along the vaulted chambers, and the ascent<br/>
Up to the emerald-tinted light of day,<br/>
He harasses his way,<br/>
Till lifeless, underneath his grasp,<br/>
The huge Sea-Monster lay.<br/>

<p class="stanza">18.</p>
That obstinate work is done! Ladurlad cried,<br/>
One labour yet remains!<br/>
And thoughtfully he eyed<br/>
Ereenia&rsquo;s ponderous chains;<br/>
And with vain effort, half-despairing, tried<br/>
The rivets deep in-driven. Instinctively,<br/>
As if in search of aid, he look&rsquo;d around:<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{54}</span></p>
Oh, then, how gladly, in the near alcove,<br/>
Fallen on the ground its lifeless Lord beside,<br/>
The crescent scymitar he spied,<br/>
Whose cloudy blade, with potent spells imbued,<br/>
Had lain so many an age unhurt in solitude.<br/>

<p class="stanza">19.</p>
Joyfully springing there<br/>
He seiz&rsquo;d the weapon, and with eager stroke<br/>
Hew&rsquo;d at the chain; the force was dealt in vain,<br/>
For not as if through yielding air<br/>
Past the descending scymitar,<br/>
Its deaden&rsquo;d way the heavy water broke;<br/>
Yet it bit deep. Again, with both his hands,<br/>
He wields the blade, and dealt a surer blow.<br/>
The baser metal yields<br/>
To that fine edge, and lo! the Glendoveer<br/>
Rises and snaps the half-sever&rsquo;d links, and stands<br/>
Freed from his broken bands.<br/>

BALY.
</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">{55}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">1.</p>
This is the appointed night,<br/>
The night of joy and consecrated mirth,<br/>
When, from his judgement-seat in Padalon,<br/>
By Yamen&rsquo;s throne,<br/>
Baly goes forth, that he may walk the Earth<br/>
Unseen, and hear his name<br/>
Still hymn&rsquo;d and honour&rsquo;d by the grateful voice<br/>
Of humankind, and in his fame rejoice.<br/>
Therefore from door to door, and street to street,<br/>
With willing feet,<br/>
Shaking their firebrands, the glad children run;<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{56}</span></p>
Baly! great Baly! they acclaim,<br/>
Where&rsquo;er they run they bear the mighty name;<br/>
Where&rsquo;er they meet,<br/>
Baly! great Baly! still their choral tongues repeat.<br/>
Therefore at every door the votive flame<br/>
Through pendant lanthorns sheds its painted light,<br/>
And rockets hissing upward through the sky,<br/>
Fall like a shower of stars<br/>
From Heaven&rsquo;s black canopy.<br/>
Therefore, on yonder mountain&rsquo;s templed height,<br/>
The brazen cauldron blazes through the night.<br/>
Huge as a Ship that travels the main sea<br/>
Is that capacious brass; its wick as tall<br/>
As is the mast of some great admiral.<br/>
Ten thousand votaries bring<br/>
Camphor and ghee to feed the sacred flame;<br/>
And while, through regions round, the nations see<br/>
Its fiery pillar curling high in heaven,<br/>
Baly! great Baly! they exclaim,<br/>
For ever hallowed be his blessed name!<br/>
Honour and praise to him for ever more be given!<br/>

<p class="stanza">2.</p>
Why art not thou among the festive throng,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{57}</span></p>
Baly, O Mighty One! to hear thy fame?<br/>
Still as of yore, with pageantry and song<br/>
The glowing streets along,<br/>
They celebrate thy name;<br/>
Baly! great Baly! still<br/>
The grateful habitants of Earth acclaim,<br/>
Baly! great Baly! still<br/>
The ringing walls and echoing towers proclaim.<br/>
From yonder mountain the portentous flame<br/>
Still blazes to the nations as before;<br/>
All things appear to human eyes the same,<br/>
As perfect as of yore;<br/>
To human eyes, . . but how unlike to thine!<br/>
Thine which were wont to see<br/>
The Company divine,<br/>
That with their presence came to honour thee!<br/>
For all the blessed ones of mortal birth<br/>
Who have been cloth&rsquo;d with immortality,<br/>
From the eight corners of the Earth,<br/>
From the Seven Worlds assembling, all<br/>
Wont to attend thy solemn festival.<br/>
Then did thine eyes behold<br/>
The wide air peopled with that glorious train,<br/>
Now may&rsquo;st thou seek the blessed ones in vain,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{58}</span></p>
For Earth and Air are now beneath the Rajah&rsquo;s reign.<br/>

<p class="stanza">3.</p>
Therefore the Mighty One hath walk&rsquo;d the Earth<br/>
In sorrow and in solitude to-night.<br/>
The sound of human mirth<br/>
To him is no delight;<br/>
He turns away from that ungrateful sight,<br/>
Hallowed not now by visitants divine,<br/>
And there he bends his melancholy way<br/>
Where, in yon full-orb&rsquo;d Moon&rsquo;s refulgent light,<br/>
The Golden Towers of his old City shine<br/>
Above the silver sea. The mighty Chief<br/>
There bent his way in grief,<br/>
As if sad thoughts indulged would work their own relief.<br/>

<p class="stanza">4.</p>
There he beholds upon the sand<br/>
A lovely Maiden in the moonlight stand.<br/>
The land-breeze lifts her locks of jet,<br/>
The waves around her polish&rsquo;d ancles play,<br/>
Her bosom with the salt sea-spray is wet;<br/>
Her arms are crost, unconsciously, to fold<br/>
That bosom from the cold,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{59}</span></p>
While statue-like she seems her watch to keep,<br/>
Gazing intently on the restless deep.<br/>

<p class="stanza">5.</p>
Seven miserable days had Kailyal there,<br/>
From earliest dawn till evening, watch&rsquo;d the deep;<br/>
Six nights within the chamber of the rock,<br/>
Had laid her down, and found in prayer<br/>
That comfort which she sought in vain from sleep.<br/>
But when the seventh night came,<br/>
Never should she behold her Father more,<br/>
The wretched Maiden said in her despair;<br/>
Yet would not quit the shore,<br/>
Nor turn her eyes one moment from the sea:<br/>
Never before<br/>
Had Kailyal watch&rsquo;d it so impatiently,<br/>
Never so eagerly had hop&rsquo;d before,<br/>
As now when she believ&rsquo;d, and said, all hope was o&rsquo;er.<br/>

<p class="stanza">6.</p>
Beholding her, how beautiful she stood,<br/>
In that wild solitude,<br/>
Baly from his invisibility<br/>
Had issued then, to know her cause of woe;<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{60}</span></p>
But that, in the air beside her, he espied<br/>
Two Powers of Evil for her hurt allied,<br/>
Foul Arvalan and dreadful Lorrinite.<br/>
The Mighty One they could not see,<br/>
And marking with what demon-like delight<br/>
They kept their innocent prey in sight,<br/>
He waits, expecting what the end may be.<br/>

<p class="stanza">7.</p>
She starts; for lo! where floating many a rood,<br/>
A Monster, hugest of the Ocean brood,<br/>
Weltering and lifeless, drifts toward the shore.<br/>
Backward she starts in fear before the flood,<br/>
And, when the waves retreat,<br/>
They leave their hideous burthen at her feet.<br/>

<p class="stanza">8.</p>
She ventures to approach with timid tread,<br/>
She starts, and half draws back in fear,<br/>
Then stops, and stretches on her head,<br/>
To see if that huge beast indeed be dead.<br/>
Now growing bold, the Maid advances near,<br/>
Even to the margin of the ocean-flood.<br/>
Rightly she reads her Father&rsquo;s victory,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{61}</span></p>
And lifts her joyous hands, exultingly,<br/>
To Heaven in gratitude.<br/>
Then spreading them toward the Sea,<br/>
While pious tears bedim her streaming eyes,<br/>
Come! come! my Father, come to me!<br/>
Ereenia, come! she cries.<br/>
Lo! from the opening deep they rise,<br/>
And to Ladurlad&rsquo;s arms the happy Kailyal flies.<br/>

<p class="stanza">9.</p>
She turn&rsquo;d from him, to meet, with beating heart,<br/>
The Glendoveer&rsquo;s embrace.<br/>
Now turn to me, for mine thou art!<br/>
Foul Arvalan exdaim&rsquo;d; his loathsome face<br/>
Came forth, and from the air,<br/>
In fleshly form, he burst.<br/>
Always in horror and despair,<br/>
Had Kailyal seen that form and face accurst,<br/>
But yet so sharp a pang had ne&rsquo;er<br/>
Shot with a thrill like death through all her frame,<br/>
As now when on her hour of joy the Spectre came.<br/>

<p class="stanza">10.</p>
Vain is resistance now,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{62}</span></p>
The fiendish laugh of Lorrinite is heard;<br/>
And, at her dreadful word,<br/>
The Asuras once again appear,<br/>
And seize Ladurlad and the Glendoveer.<br/>

<p class="stanza">11.</p>
Hold your accursed hands!<br/>
A Voice exclaim&rsquo;d, whose dread commands<br/>
Were fear&rsquo;d through all the vaults of Padalon;<br/>
And there among them, in the midnight air,<br/>
The presence of the mighty Baly shone.<br/>
He, making manifest his mightiness,<br/>
Put forth on every side an hundred arms,<br/>
And seiz&rsquo;d the Sorceress; maugre all her charms,<br/>
Her and her fiendish ministers he caught<br/>
With force as uncontroulable as fate;<br/>
And that unhappy Soul, to whom<br/>
The Almighty Rajah&rsquo;s power availeth not<br/>
Living to avert, nor dead to mitigate<br/>
His righteous doom.<br/>

<p class="stanza">12.</p>
Help, help, Kehama! Father, help! he cried;<br/>
But Baly tarried not to abide<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{63}</span></p>
That mightier Power; with irresistible feet<br/>
He stampt and cleft the Earth; it opened wide,<br/>
And gave him way to his own judgement-seat.<br/>
Down, like a plummet, to the World below<br/>
He sunk, and bore his prey<br/>
To righteous punishment, and endless woe.<br/>

KEHAMA&rsquo;S DESCENT.
</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">{64}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">1.</p>
The Earth, by Baly&rsquo;s feet divided,<br/>
Clos&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er his way as to the judgement-seat<br/>
He plunged and bore his prey.<br/>
Scarce had the shock subsided,<br/>
When, darting from the Swerga&rsquo;s heavenly heights,<br/>
Kehama, like a thunderbolt, alights.<br/>
In wrath he came, a bickering flame<br/>
Flash&rsquo;d from his eyes which made the moonlight dim,<br/>
And passion forcing way from every limb,<br/>
Like furnace-smoke, with terrors wrapt him round.<br/>
Furious he smote the ground;<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{65}</span></p>
Earth trembled underneath the dreadful stroke,<br/>
Again in sunder riven;<br/>
He hurl&rsquo;d in rage his whirling weapon down.<br/>
But lo! the fiery sheckra to his feet<br/>
Return&rsquo;d, as if by equal force re-driven,<br/>
And from the abyss the voice of Baly came:<br/>
Not yet, O Rajah, hast thou won<br/>
The realms of Padalon!<br/>
Earth and the Swerga are thine own,<br/>
But, till Kehama shall subdue the throne<br/>
Of Hell, in torments Yamen holds his son.<br/>

<p class="stanza">2.</p>
Fool that he is! . . in torments let him lie!<br/>
Kehama, wrathful at his son, replied.<br/>
But what am I<br/>
That thou should&rsquo;st brave me? . . kindling in his pride<br/>
The dreadful Rajah cried.<br/>
Ho! Yamen! hear me. God of Padalon,<br/>
Prepare thy throne,<br/>
And let the Amreeta cup<br/>
Be ready for my lips, when I anon<br/>
Triumphantly shall take my seat thereon,<br/>
And plant upon thy neck my royal feet.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{66}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">3.</p>
In voice like thunder thus the Rajah cried,<br/>
Impending o&rsquo;er the abyss, with menacing hand<br/>
Put forth, as in the action of command,<br/>
And eyes that darted their red anger down.<br/>
Then drawing back he let the earth subside,<br/>
And, as his wrath relax&rsquo;d, survey&rsquo;d,<br/>
Thoughtful and silently, the mortal Maid.<br/>
Her eye the while was on the farthest sky,<br/>
Where up the etherial height<br/>
Ereenia rose and past away from sight.<br/>
Never had she so joyfully<br/>
Beheld the coming of the Glendoveer,<br/>
Dear as he was and he deserv&rsquo;d to be,<br/>
As now she saw him rise and disappear.<br/>
Come now what will, within her heart said she,<br/>
For thou art safe, and what have I to fear?<br/>

<p class="stanza">4.</p>
Meantime the Almighty Rajah, late<br/>
In power and majesty and wrath array&rsquo;d,<br/>
Had laid his terrors by<br/>
And gaz&rsquo;d upon the Maid.<br/>
Pride could not quit his eye,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{67}</span></p>
Nor that remorseless nature from his front<br/>
Depart; yet whoso had beheld him then<br/>
Had felt some admiration mix&rsquo;d with dread,<br/>
And might have said<br/>
That sure he seem&rsquo;d to be the King of Men;<br/>
Less than the greatest that he could not be,<br/>
Who carried in his port such might and majesty.<br/>

<p class="stanza">5.</p>
In fear no longer for the Glendoveer,<br/>
Now toward the Rajah Kailyal turn&rsquo;d her eyes<br/>
As if to ask what doom awaited her.<br/>
But then surprise,<br/>
Even as with fascination, held them there,<br/>
So strange a thing it seem&rsquo;d to see the change<br/>
Of purport in that all-commanding brow,<br/>
That thoughtfully was bent upon her now.<br/>
Wondering she gaz&rsquo;d, the while her Father&rsquo;s eye<br/>
Was fix&rsquo;d upon Kehama haughtily;<br/>
It spake defiance to him, high disdain,<br/>
Stern patience, unsubduable by pain,<br/>
And pride triumphant over agony.<br/>

<p class="stanza">6.</p>
Ladurlad, said the Rajah, thou and I<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{68}</span></p>
Alike have done the work of Destiny,<br/>
Unknowing each to what the impulse tended;<br/>
But now that over Earth and Heaven my reign<br/>
Is stablish&rsquo;d, and the ways of Fate are plain<br/>
Before me, here our enmity is ended.<br/>
I take away thy Curse. . . As thus he said,<br/>
The fire which in Ladurlad&rsquo;s heart and brain<br/>
Was burning, fled, and left him free from pain.<br/>
So rapidly his torments were departed,<br/>
That at the sudden ease he started,<br/>
As with a shock, and to his head<br/>
His hands up-fled,<br/>
As if he felt through every failing limb<br/>
The power and sense of life forsaking him.<br/>

<p class="stanza">7.</p>
Then turning to the Maid, the Rajah cried,<br/>
O Virgin, above all of mortal birth<br/>
Favour&rsquo;d alike in beauty and in worth,<br/>
And in the glories of thy destiny,<br/>
Now let thy happy heart exult with pride,<br/>
For Fate hath chosen thee<br/>
To be Kehama&rsquo;s bride,<br/>
To be the Queen of Heaven and Earth,<br/>
And of whatever Worlds beside<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{69}</span></p>
Infinity may hide . . . For I can see<br/>
The writing which, at thy nativity,<br/>
All-knowing Nature wrought upon thy brain,<br/>
In branching veins, which to the gifted eye<br/>
Map out the mazes of futurity.<br/>
There is it written, Maid, that thou and I,<br/>
Alone of human kind a deathless pair,<br/>
Are doom&rsquo;d to share<br/>
The Amreeta-drink divine<br/>
Of immortality. Come, Maiden mine!<br/>
High-fated One, ascend the subject sky,<br/>
And by Kehama&rsquo;s side<br/>
Sit on the Swerga throne, his equal bride.<br/>

<p class="stanza">8.</p>
Oh never, . . never . . Father! Kailyal cried;<br/>
It is not as he saith, . . it cannot be!<br/>
I! . . I, his bride!<br/>
Nature is never false; he wrongeth her!<br/>
My heart belies such lines of destiny.<br/>
There is no other true interpreter!<br/>

<p class="stanza">9.</p>
At that reply Kehama&rsquo;s darkening brow<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{70}</span></p>
Bewray&rsquo;d the anger which he yet supprest.<br/>
Counsel thy daughter; tell her thou art now<br/>
Free from thy Curse, he said, and bid her bow<br/>
In thankfulness to Fate&rsquo;s benign behest.<br/>
Bid her her stubborn will restrain,<br/>
For Destiny at last must be obey&rsquo;d,<br/>
And tell her, while obedience is delay&rsquo;d,<br/>
Thy Curse will burn again.<br/>

<p class="stanza">10.</p>
She needeth not my counsel, he replied,<br/>
And idly, Rajah, dost thou reason thus<br/>
Of Destiny! for though all other things<br/>
Were subject to the starry influencings,<br/>
And bow&rsquo;d submissive to thy tyranny,<br/>
The virtuous heart, and resolute will are free.<br/>
Thus in their wisdom did the Gods decree<br/>
When they created man. Let come what will,<br/>
This is our rock of strength; in every ill,<br/>
Sorrow, oppression, pain and agony,<br/>
The spirit of the good is unsubdued,<br/>
And, suffer as they may, they triumph still.<br/>

<p class="stanza">11.</p>
Obstinate fools! exclaim&rsquo;d the Mighty One,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{71}</span></p>
Fate and my pleasure must be done,<br/>
And ye resist in vain!<br/>
Take your fit guerdon till we meet again!<br/>
So saying, his vindictive hand he flung<br/>
Towards them, fill&rsquo;d with curses; then on high<br/>
Aloft he sprung, and vanish&rsquo;d through the Sky.<br/>

MOUNT CALASAY.

<p><span class="pagenum">{72}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">1.</p>
The Rajah, scattering curses as he rose,<br/>
Soar&rsquo;d to the Swerga, and resum&rsquo;d his throne.<br/>
Not for his own redoubled agony,<br/>
Which now through heart and brain,<br/>
With renovated pain,<br/>
Rush&rsquo;d to its seat, Ladurlad breathes that groan,<br/>
That groan is for his child; he groan&rsquo;d to see<br/>
The lovely one defil&rsquo;d with leprosy,<br/>
Which, as the enemy vindictive fled,<br/>
O&rsquo;er all her frame with quick contagion spread.<br/>
She, wondering at events so passing strange,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{73}</span></p>
And fill&rsquo;d with hope and fear,<br/>
And joy to see the Tyrant disappear,<br/>
And glad expectance of her Glendoveer,<br/>
Perceiv&rsquo;d not in herself the hideous change.<br/>
His burning pain, she thought, had forced the groan<br/>
Her father breath&rsquo;d; his agonies alone<br/>
Were present to her mind; she claspt his knees,<br/>
Wept for his Curse, and did not feel her own.<br/>

<p class="stanza">2.</p>
Nor when she saw her plague, did her good heart,<br/>
True to itself, even for a moment fail.<br/>
Ha, Rajah! with disdainful smile she cries,<br/>
Mighty and wise and wicked as thou art,<br/>
Still thy blind vengeance acts a friendly part.<br/>
Shall I not thank thee for this scurf and scale<br/>
Of dire deformity, whose loathsomeness,<br/>
Surer than panoply of strongest mail,<br/>
Arms me against all foes? Oh, better so,<br/>
Better such foul disgrace,<br/>
Than that this innocent face<br/>
Should tempt thy wooing! That I need not dread;<br/>
Nor ever impious foe<br/>
Will offer outrage now, nor farther woe<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{74}</span></p>
Will beauty draw on my unhappy head;<br/>
Safe through the unholy world may Kailyal go.<br/>

<p class="stanza">3.</p>
Her face in virtuous pride<br/>
Was lifted to the skies,<br/>
As him and his poor vengeance she defied;<br/>
But earthward, when she ceas&rsquo;d, she turn&rsquo;d her eyes,<br/>
As if she sought to hide<br/>
The tear which in her own despite would rise.<br/>
Did then the thought of her own Glendoveer<br/>
Call forth that natural tear?<br/>
Was it a woman&rsquo;s fear,<br/>
A thought of earthly love, which troubled her?<br/>
Like yon thin cloud amid the moonlight sky<br/>
That flits before the wind<br/>
And leaves no trace behind,<br/>
The womanly pang past over Kailyal&rsquo;s mind.<br/>
This is a loathsome sight to human eye,<br/>
Half-shrinking at herself, the Maiden thought,<br/>
Will it be so to him? Oh surely not!<br/>
The immortal Powers, who see<br/>
Through the poor wrappings of mortality,<br/>
Behold the soul, the beautiful soul, within,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{75}</span></p>
Exempt from age and wasting malady,<br/>
And undeform&rsquo;d, while pure and free from sin.<br/>
This is a loathsome sight to human eye,<br/>
But not to eyes divine,<br/>
Ereenia, Son of Heaven, oh not to thine!<br/>

<p class="stanza">4.</p>
The wrongful thought of fear, the womanly pain<br/>
Had past away, her heart was calm again.<br/>
She rais&rsquo;d her head, expecting now to see<br/>
The Glendoveer appear;<br/>
Where hath he fled, quoth she,<br/>
That he should tarry now? Oh had she known<br/>
Whither the adventurous Son of Heaven was flown,<br/>
Strong as her spirit was, it had not borne<br/>
The awful thought, nor dar&rsquo;d to hope for his return.<br/>

<p class="stanza">5.</p>
For he in search of Seeva&rsquo;s throne was gone,<br/>
To tell his tale of wrong;<br/>
In search of Seeva&rsquo;s own abode<br/>
The daring one began his heavenly road.<br/>
O wild emprize! above the farthest skies<br/>
He hop&rsquo;d to rise!<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{76}</span></p>
Him who is thron&rsquo;d beyond the reach of thought,<br/>
The Alone, the Inaccessible, he sought.<br/>
O wild emprize! for when in days of yore,<br/>
For proud pre-eminence of power,<br/>
Brama and Veeshnoo, wild with rage, contended,<br/>
And Seeva, in his might,<br/>
Their dread contention ended;<br/>
Before their sight<br/>
In form a fiery column did he tower,<br/>
Whose head above the highest height extended,<br/>
Whose base below the deepest depth descended.<br/>
Downward, its depth to sound,<br/>
Veeshnoo a thousand years explor&rsquo;d<br/>
The fathomless profound,<br/>
And yet no base he found:<br/>
Upward, to reach its head,<br/>
Ten myriad years the aspiring Brama soar&rsquo;d,<br/>
And still, as up he fled,<br/>
Above him still the Immeasurable spread.<br/>
The rivals own&rsquo;d their lord,<br/>
And trembled and ador&rsquo;d.<br/>
How shall the Glendoveer attain<br/>
What Brama and what Veeshnoo sought in vain?<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{77}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">6.</p>
Ne&rsquo;er did such thought of lofty daring enter<br/>
Celestial Spirit&rsquo;s mind. O wild adventure<br/>
That throne to find, for he must leave behind<br/>
This World, that in the centre,<br/>
Within its salt-sea girdle, lies confin&rsquo;d;<br/>
Yea the Seven Earths that, each with its own ocean,<br/>
Ring clasping ring, compose the mighty round.<br/>
What power of motion,<br/>
In less than endless years shall bear him there,<br/>
Along the limitless extent,<br/>
To the utmost bound of the remotest spheres?<br/>
What strength of wing<br/>
Suffice to pierce the Golden Firmament<br/>
That closes all within?<br/>
Yet he hath past the measureless extent,<br/>
And pierced the Golden Firmament;<br/>
For Faith hath given him power, and Space and Time<br/>
Vanish before that energy sublime.<br/>
Nor doth Eternal Night,<br/>
And outer Darkness, check his resolute flight;<br/>
By strong desire through all he makes his way,<br/>
Till Seeva&rsquo;s Seat appears, . . behold Mount Calasay!<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{78}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">7.</p>
Behold the Silver Mountain! round about<br/>
Seven ladders stand, so high, the aching eye,<br/>
Seeking their tops in vain amid the sky,<br/>
Might deem they led from earth to highest heaven.<br/>
Ages would pass away,<br/>
And Worlds with age decay,<br/>
Ere one whose patient feet from ring to ring<br/>
Must win their upward way,<br/>
Could reach the summit of Mount Calasay.<br/>
But that strong power that nerv&rsquo;d his wing,<br/>
That all-surmounting will,<br/>
Intensity of faith and holiest love,<br/>
Sustain&rsquo;d Ereenia still,<br/>
And he hath gain&rsquo;d the plain, the sanctuary above.<br/>

<p class="stanza">8.</p>
Lo, there the Silver Bell,<br/>
That, self-sustain&rsquo;d, hangs buoyant in the air!<br/>
Lo! the broad Table there, too bright<br/>
For mortal sight,<br/>
From whose four sides the bordering gems unite<br/>
Their harmonizing rays,<br/>
In one mid fount of many-colour&rsquo;d light.<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{79}</span></p>
The stream of splendour, flashing as it flows,<br/>
Plays round, and feeds the stem of yon celestial Rose.<br/>
Where is the Sage whose wisdom can declare<br/>
The hidden things of that mysterious flower,<br/>
That flower which serves all mysteries to bear?<br/>
The sacred triangle is there,<br/>
Holding the Emblem which no tongue may tell.<br/>
Is this the Heaven of Heavens, where Seeva&rsquo;s self doth dwell?<br/>

<p class="stanza">9.</p>
Here first the Glendoveer<br/>
Felt his wing flag, and paus&rsquo;d upon his flight.<br/>
Was it that fear came over him, when here<br/>
He saw the imagin&rsquo;d throne appear?<br/>
Not so, for his immortal sight<br/>
Endur&rsquo;d the Table&rsquo;s light;<br/>
Distinctly he beheld all things around,<br/>
And doubt and wonder rose within his mind<br/>
That this was all he found.<br/>
Howbeit he lifted up his voice and spake.<br/>
There is oppression in the World below;<br/>
Earth groans beneath the yoke; yea, in her woe,<br/>
She asks if the Avenger&rsquo;s eye is blind?<br/>
Awake, O Lord, awake!<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{80}</span></p>
Too long thy vengeance sleepeth. Holy One!<br/>
Put thou thy terrors on for mercy&rsquo;s sake,<br/>
And strike the blow, in justice to mankind!<br/>

<p class="stanza">10.</p>
So as he pray&rsquo;d, intenser faith he felt,<br/>
His spirit seem&rsquo;d to melt<br/>
With ardent yearnings of increasing love;<br/>
Upward he turn&rsquo;d his eyes<br/>
As if there should be something yet above;<br/>
Let me not, Seeva! seek in vain! he cries,<br/>
Thou art not here, . . for how should these contain thee?<br/>
Thou art not here, . . for how should I sustain thee?<br/>
But thou, where&rsquo;er thou art,<br/>
Canst hear the voice of prayer,<br/>
Canst hear the humble heart.<br/>
Thy dwelling who can tell,<br/>
Or who, O Lord, hath seen thy secret throne?<br/>
But thou art not alone,<br/>
Not unapproachable!<br/>
O all-containing Mind,<br/>
Thou who art every where,<br/>
Whom all who seek shall find,<br/>
Hear me, O Seeva! hear the suppliant&rsquo;s prayer!<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{81}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">11.</p>
So saying, up he sprung,<br/>
And struck the Bell, which self-suspended, hung<br/>
Before the mystic Rose.<br/>
From side to side the silver tongue<br/>
Melodious swung, and far and wide<br/>
Soul-thrilling tones of heavenly music rung.<br/>
Abash&rsquo;d, confounded,<br/>
It left the Glendoveer; . . yea all astounded<br/>
In overpowering fear and deep dismay;<br/>
For when that Bell had sounded,<br/>
The Rose, with all the mysteries it surrounded,<br/>
The Bell, the Table, and Mount Calasay,<br/>
The holy Hill itself, with all thereon,<br/>
Even as a morning dream before the day<br/>
Dissolves away, they faded and were gone.<br/>

<p class="stanza">12.</p>
Where shall he rest his wing, where turn for flight,<br/>
For all around is Light,<br/>
Primal, essential, all-pervading Light!<br/>
Heart cannot think, nor tongue declare,<br/>
Nor eyes of Angel bear<br/>
That Glory unimaginably bright;<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{82}</span></p>
The Sun himself had seem&rsquo;d<br/>
A speck of darkness there,<br/>
Amid that Light of Light!<br/>

<p class="stanza">13.</p>
Down fell the Glendoveer,<br/>
Down through all regions, to our mundane sphere<br/>
He fell; but in his ear<br/>
A voice, which from within him came, was heard,<br/>
The indubitable word<br/>
Of Him to whom all secret things are known:<br/>
Go, ye who suffer, go to Yamen&rsquo;s throne.<br/>
He hath the remedy for every woe;<br/>
He setteth right whate&rsquo;er is wrong below.<br/>

THE EMBARKATION.
</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">{83}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">1.</p>
Down from the Heaven of Heavens Ereenia fell<br/>
Precipitate, yet imperceptible<br/>
His fall, nor had he cause nor thought of fear;<br/>
And when he came within this mundane sphere,<br/>
And felt that Earth was near,<br/>
The Glendoveer his azure wings expanded,<br/>
And, sloping down the sky<br/>
Toward the spot from whence he sprung on high,<br/>
There on the shore he landed.<br/>

<p class="stanza">2.</p>
Kailyal advanced to meet him,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{84}</span></p>
Not moving now as she was wont to greet him;<br/>
Joy in her eye and in her eager pace;<br/>
With a calm smile of melancholy pride<br/>
She met him now, and, turning half aside,<br/>
Her warning hand repell&rsquo;d the dear embrace.<br/>
Strange things, Ereenia, have befallen us here,<br/>
The Virgin said; the Almighty Man hath read<br/>
The lines which, traced by Nature on my brain,<br/>
There to the gifted eye<br/>
Make all my fortunes plain,<br/>
Mapping the mazes of futurity.<br/>
He sued for peace, for it is written there<br/>
That I with him the Amreeta cup must share;<br/>
Wherefore he bade me come, and by his side<br/>
Sit on the Swerga-throne, his equal bride.<br/>
I need not tell thee what reply was given;<br/>
My heart, the sure interpreter of Heaven,<br/>
His impious words belied.<br/>
Thou seest his poor revenge! So having said,<br/>
One look she glanced upon her leprous stain<br/>
Indignantly, and shook<br/>
Her head in calm disdain.<br/>

<p class="stanza">3.</p>
O Maid of soul divine!<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{85}</span></p>
O more than ever dear,<br/>
And more than ever mine,<br/>
Replied the Glendoveer;<br/>
He hath not read, be sure, the mystic ways<br/>
Of Fate; almighty as he is, that maze<br/>
Hath mock&rsquo;d his fallible sight.<br/>
Said he the Amreeta-cup? So far aright<br/>
The Evil One may see; for Fate displays<br/>
Her hidden things in part, and part conceals,<br/>
Baffling the wicked eye<br/>
Alike with what she hides, and what reveals,<br/>
When with unholy purpose it would pry<br/>
Into the secrets of futurity.<br/>
So may it be permitted him to see<br/>
Dimly the inscrutable decree;<br/>
For to the world below,<br/>
Where Yamen guards the Amreeta, we must go;<br/>
Thus Seeva hath exprest his will, even he<br/>
The Holiest hath ordain&rsquo;d it; there, he saith,<br/>
All wrongs shall be redrest<br/>
By Yamen, by the righteous Power of Death.<br/>

<p class="stanza">4.</p>
Forthwith the Father and the fated Maid,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{86}</span></p>
And that heroic Spirit, who for them<br/>
Such flight had late essay&rsquo;d,<br/>
The will of Heaven obey&rsquo;d.<br/>
They went their way along the road<br/>
That leads to Yamen&rsquo;s dread abode.<br/>

<p class="stanza">5.</p>
Many a day hath past away<br/>
Since they began their arduous way,<br/>
Their way of toil and pain;<br/>
And now their weary feet attain<br/>
The Earth&rsquo;s remotest bound<br/>
Where outer Ocean girds it round.<br/>
But not like other Oceans this,<br/>
Rather it seem&rsquo;d a drear abyss,<br/>
Upon whose brink they stood.<br/>
Oh, scene of fear! the travellers hear<br/>
The raging of the flood;<br/>
They hear how fearfully it roars,<br/>
But clouds of darker shade than night<br/>
For ever hovering round those shores,<br/>
Hide all things from their sight.<br/>
The Sun upon that darkness pours<br/>
His unavailing light;<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{87}</span></p>
Nor ever Moon nor Stars display,<br/>
Through the thick shade, one guiding ray<br/>
To shew the perils of the way.<br/>

<p class="stanza">6.</p>
There, in a creek, a vessel lay.<br/>
Just on the confines of the day,<br/>
It rode at anchor in its bay,<br/>
These venturous pilgrims to convey<br/>
Across that outer Sea.<br/>
Strange vessel sure it seem&rsquo;d to be,<br/>
And all unfit for such wild sea!<br/>
For through its yawning side the wave<br/>
Was oozing in; the mast was frail,<br/>
And old and torn its only sail.<br/>
How shall that crazy vessel brave<br/>
The billows, that in wild commotion<br/>
For ever roar and rave?<br/>
How hope to cross the dreadful Ocean,<br/>
O&rsquo;er which eternal shadows dwell,<br/>
Whose secrets none return to tell!<br/>

<p class="stanza">7.</p>
Well might the travellers fear to enter!<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{88}</span></p>
But summon&rsquo;d once on that adventure,<br/>
For them was no retreat.<br/>
Nor boots it with reluctant feet<br/>
To linger on the strand;<br/>
Aboard! aboard!<br/>
An awful voice, that left no choice,<br/>
Sent forth its stern command,<br/>
Aboard! aboard!<br/>
The travellers hear that voice in fear,<br/>
And breathe to Heaven an inward prayer,<br/>
And take their seats in silence there.<br/>

<p class="stanza">8.</p>
Self-hoisted then, behold the sail<br/>
Expands itself before the gale;<br/>
Hands, which they cannot see, let slip<br/>
The cable of that fated ship;<br/>
The land breeze sends her on her way,<br/>
And lo! they leave the living light of day!<br/>

Swift as an arrow in its flight<br/>
The Ship shot through the incumbent night;<br/>
And they have left behind<br/>
The raging billows and the roaring wind,<br/>
The storm, the darkness, and all mortal fears;<br/>
And lo! another light<br/>
To guide their way appears,<br/>
The light of other spheres.<br/>

That instant, from Ladurlad&rsquo;s heart and brain<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{90}</span></p>
The Curse was gone; he feels again<br/>
Fresh as in Youth&rsquo;s fair morning, and the Maid<br/>
Hath lost her leprous stain.<br/>
The dreadful Man hath no dominion here,<br/>
Starting she cried; O happy, happy hour!<br/>
We are beyond his power!<br/>
Then raising to the Glendoveer,<br/>
With heavenly beauty bright, her angel face,<br/>
Turn&rsquo;d not reluctant now, and met his dear embrace.<br/>

<p class="stanza">3.</p>
Swift glides the Ship, with gentle motion,<br/>
Across that calm and quiet ocean;<br/>
That glassy sea, which seem&rsquo;d to be<br/>
The mirror of tranquillity.<br/>
Their pleasant passage soon was o&rsquo;er,<br/>
The Ship hath reach&rsquo;d its destin&rsquo;d shore;<br/>
A level belt of ice which bound,<br/>
As with an adamantine mound,<br/>
The waters of the sleeping Ocean round.<br/>
Strange forms were on the strand<br/>
Of earth-born spirits slain before their time;<br/>
Who, wandering over sea and sky and land,<br/>
Had so fulfill&rsquo;d their term; and now were met<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{91}</span></p>
Upon this icy belt, a motley band,<br/>
Waiting their summons, at the appointed hour<br/>
When each before the judgement-seat must stand,<br/>
And hear his doom from Baly&rsquo;s righteous power.<br/>

<p class="stanza">4.</p>
Foul with habitual crimes, a hideous crew<br/>
Were there, the race of rapine and of blood.<br/>
Now, having overpast the mortal flood,<br/>
Their own deformity they knew,<br/>
And knew the meed that to their deeds was due.<br/>
Therefore in fear and agony they stood,<br/>
Expecting when the evil Messenger<br/>
Among them should appear. But with their fear<br/>
A hope was mingled now;<br/>
O&rsquo;er the dark shade of guilt a deeper hue<br/>
It threw, and gave a fiercer character<br/>
To the wild eye and lip and sinful brow.<br/>
They hop&rsquo;d that soon Kehama would subdue<br/>
The inexorable God, and seize his throne,<br/>
Reduce the infernal World to his command,<br/>
And, with his irresistible right hand,<br/>
Redeem them from the vaults of Padalon.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{92}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">5.</p>
Apart from these a milder company,<br/>
The victims of offences not their own,<br/>
Look&rsquo;d when the appointed Messenger should come;<br/>
Gathered together some, and some alone<br/>
Brooding in silence on their future doom.<br/>
Widows whom, to their husbands&rsquo; funeral fire,<br/>
Force or strong error led, to share the pyre,<br/>
As to their everlasting marriage-bed:<br/>
And babes, by sin unstain&rsquo;d,<br/>
Whom erring parents vow&rsquo;d<br/>
To Ganges, and the holy stream profan&rsquo;d<br/>
With that strange sacrifice, rite unordain&rsquo;d<br/>
By Law, by sacred Nature unallow&rsquo;d:<br/>
Others more hapless in their destiny,<br/>
Scarce having first inhaled this vital breath,<br/>
Whose cradles from some tree<br/>
Unnatural hands suspended,<br/>
Then left, till gentle Death,<br/>
Coming like Sleep, their feeble moanings ended;<br/>
Or for his prey the ravenous Kite descended;<br/>
Or, marching like an army from their caves,<br/>
The Pismires blacken&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er, then bleach&rsquo;d and bare<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{93}</span></p>
Left their unharden&rsquo;d bones to fall asunder there.<br/>

<p class="stanza">6.</p>
Innocent Souls! thus set so early free<br/>
From sin and sorrow and mortality,<br/>
Their spotless spirits all-creating Love<br/>
Receiv&rsquo;d into its universal breast.<br/>
Yon blue serene above<br/>
Was their domain; clouds pillowed them to rest;<br/>
The Elements on them like nurses tended,<br/>
And with their growth etherial substance blended.<br/>
Less pure than these is that strange Indian bird<br/>
Who never dips in earthly streams her bill,<br/>
But, when the sound of coming showers is heard,<br/>
Looks up, and from the clouds receives her fill.<br/>
Less pure the footless fowl of Heaven, that never<br/>
Rest upon earth, but on the wing for ever<br/>
Hovering o&rsquo;er flowers, their fragrant food inhale,<br/>
Drink the descending dew upon its way,<br/>
And sleep aloft while floating on the gale.<br/>
And thus these innocents in yonder sky<br/>
Grow and are strengthen&rsquo;d, while the allotted years<br/>
Perform their course, then hitherward they fly,<br/>
Being free from mortal taint, so free from fears,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{94}</span></p>
A joyous band, expecting soon to soar<br/>
To Indra&rsquo;s happy spheres,<br/>
And mingle with the blessed company<br/>
Of heavenly spirits there for evermore.<br/>

<p class="stanza">7.</p>
A Gulph profound surrounded<br/>
This icy belt; the opposite side<br/>
With highest rocks was bounded;<br/>
But where their heads they hide,<br/>
Or where their base is founded,<br/>
None could espy. Above all reach of sight<br/>
They rose, the second Earth was on their height,<br/>
Their feet were fix&rsquo;d in everlasting night.<br/>

<p class="stanza">8.</p>
So deep the Gulph, no eye<br/>
Could plum its dark profundity,<br/>
Yet all its depth must try; for this the road<br/>
To Padalon, and Yamen&rsquo;s dread abode.<br/>
And from below continually<br/>
Ministrant Demons rose and caught<br/>
The Souls whose hour was come;<br/>
Then, with their burthen fraught,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{95}</span></p>
Plunged down, and bore them to receive their doom.<br/>

<p class="stanza">9.</p>
Then might be seen who went in hope, and who<br/>
Trembled to meet the meed<br/>
Of many a foul misdeed, as wild they threw<br/>
Their arms retorted from the Demons&rsquo; grasp,<br/>
And look&rsquo;d around, all eagerly, to seek<br/>
For help, where help was none; and strove for aid<br/>
To clasp the nearest shade;<br/>
Yea, with imploring looks and horrent shriek,<br/>
Even from one Demon to another bending,<br/>
With hands extending,<br/>
Their mercy they essay&rsquo;d.<br/>
Still from the verge they strain,<br/>
And from the dreadful gulph avert their eyes,<br/>
In vain; down plunge the Demons, and their cries<br/>
Feebly, as down they sink, from that profound arise.<br/>

<p class="stanza">10.</p>
What heart of living man could, undisturb&rsquo;d,<br/>
Bear sight so sad as this! What wonder there<br/>
If Kailyal&rsquo;s lip were blanch&rsquo;d with inmost dread!<br/>
The chill which from that icy belt<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{96}</span></p>
Struck through her, was less keen than what she felt<br/>
With her heart&rsquo;s-blood through every limb dispread.<br/>
Close to the Glendoveer she clung,<br/>
And clasping round his neck her trembling hands,<br/>
She clos&rsquo;d her eyes, and there in silence hung.<br/>

<p class="stanza">11.</p>
Then to Ladurlad said the Glendoveer,<br/>
These Demons, whom thou seest, the ministers<br/>
Of Yamen, wonder to behold us here;<br/>
But for the dead they come, and not for us:<br/>
Therefore, albeit they gaze upon thee thus,<br/>
Have thou no fear.<br/>
A little while thou must be left alone,<br/>
Till I have borne thy Daughter down,<br/>
And placed her safely by the throne<br/>
Of him who keeps the Gate of Padalon.<br/>

<p class="stanza">12.</p>
Then taking Kailyal in his arms, he said,<br/>
Be of good heart, Beloved! it is I<br/>
Who bear thee. Saying this, his wings he spread,<br/>
Sprung upward in the sky, and pois&rsquo;d his flight,<br/>
Then plunged into the Gulph, and sought the World of Night.<br/>

THE GATE OF PADALON.
</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">{97}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">1.</p>
The strong foundations of this inmost Earth<br/>
Rest upon Padalon. That icy Mound<br/>
Which girt the mortal Ocean round,<br/>
Reach&rsquo;d the profound, . .<br/>
Ice in the regions of the upper air,<br/>
Crystal midway, and adamant below,<br/>
Whose strength sufficed to bear<br/>
The weight of all this upper World of ours,<br/>
And with its rampart clos&rsquo;d the Realm of Woe.<br/>
Eight gates hath Padalon; eight heavenly Powers<br/>
Have them in charge, each alway at his post,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{98}</span></p>
Lest, from their penal caves, the accursed host,<br/>
Maugre the might of Baly and the God,<br/>
Should break, and carry ruin all abroad.<br/>

<p class="stanza">2.</p>
Those gates stand ever open, night and day,<br/>
And Souls of mortal men<br/>
For ever throng the way.<br/>
Some from the dolorous den,<br/>
Children of sin and wrath, return no more:<br/>
They, fit companions of the Spirits accurst,<br/>
Are doom&rsquo;d, like them in baths of fire immerst,<br/>
Or weltering upon beds of molten ore,<br/>
Or, stretch&rsquo;d upon the brazen floor,<br/>
Are fasten&rsquo;d down with adamantine chains;<br/>
While on their substance inconsumable,<br/>
Leeches of fire for ever hang and pull,<br/>
And worms of fire for ever gnaw their food,<br/>
That, still renew&rsquo;d,<br/>
Freshens for ever their perpetual pains.<br/>

<p class="stanza">3.</p>
Others there were whom Baly&rsquo;s voice condemned,<br/>
By long and painful penance, to atone<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{99}</span></p>
Their fleshly deeds. Them, from the Judgement-Throne,<br/>
Dread Azyoruca, where she sat involv&rsquo;d<br/>
In darkness as a tent, receiv&rsquo;d, and dealt<br/>
To each the measure of his punishment;<br/>
Till, in the central springs of fire, the Will<br/>
Impure is purged away; and the freed soul,<br/>
Thus fitted to receive its second birth,<br/>
Embodied once again, revisits Earth.<br/>

<p class="stanza">4.</p>
But they whom Baly&rsquo;s righteous voice absolv&rsquo;d,<br/>
And Yamen, viewing with benignant eye,<br/>
Dismiss&rsquo;d to seek their heritage on high,<br/>
How joyfully they leave this gloomy bourne,<br/>
The dread sojourn<br/>
Of Guilt and twin-born Punishment and Woe,<br/>
And wild Remorse, here link&rsquo;d with worse Despair!<br/>
They to the eastern Gate rejoicing go:<br/>
The Ship of Heaven awaits their coming there,<br/>
And on they sail, greeting the blessed light,<br/>
Through realms of upper air,<br/>
Bound for the Swerga once; but now no more<br/>
Their voyage rests upon that happy shore;<br/>
Since Indra, by the dreadful Rajah&rsquo;s might<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{100}</span></p>
Compell&rsquo;d, hath taken flight,<br/>
On to the second World their way they wend,<br/>
And there, in trembling hope, await the doubtful end.<br/>

<p class="stanza">5.</p>
For still in them doth hope predominate,<br/>
Faith&rsquo;s precious privilege, when higher Powers<br/>
Give way to fear in these portentous hours.<br/>
Behold the Wardens eight,<br/>
Each silent at his gate<br/>
Expectant stands; they turn their anxious eyes<br/>
Within, and, listening to the dizzy din<br/>
Of mutinous uproar, each in all his hands<br/>
Holds all his weapons, ready for the fight.<br/>
For, hark! what clamorous cries<br/>
Upon Kehama for deliverance call!<br/>
Come, Rajah! they exclaim, too long we groan<br/>
In torments. Come, Deliverer! yonder throne<br/>
Awaits thee . . . Now, Kehama! Rajah, now!<br/>
Earthly Almighty, wherefore tarriest thou? . .<br/>
Such were the sounds that rung, in wild uproar,<br/>
O&rsquo;er all the echoing vaults of Padalon;<br/>
And as the Asuras from the brazen floor,<br/>
Struggling against their fetters, strove to rise,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{101}</span></p>
Their clashing chains were heard, and shrieks and cries,<br/>
With curses mix&rsquo;d, against the Fiends who urge,<br/>
Fierce on their rebel limbs, the avenging scourge.<br/>

<p class="stanza">6.</p>
These were the sounds which, at the southern gate,<br/>
Assail&rsquo;d Ereenia&rsquo;s ear; alighting here<br/>
He laid before Neroodi&rsquo;s feet the Maid,<br/>
Who, pale and cold with fear,<br/>
Hung on his neck, well-nigh a lifeless weight.<br/>

<p class="stanza">7.</p>
Who and what art thou? cried the Guardian Power,<br/>
Sight thus unwonted wondering to behold, . .<br/>
O Son of Light!<br/>
Who comest here at this portentous hour,<br/>
When Yamen&rsquo;s throne<br/>
Trembles, and all our might can scarce keep down<br/>
The rebel race from seizing Padalon: . . .<br/>
Who and what art thou? and what wild despair,<br/>
Or wilder hope, from realms of upper air,<br/>
Tempts thee to bear<br/>
This mortal Maid to our forlorn abodes?<br/>
Fitter for her, I ween, the Swerga bowers,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{102}</span></p>
And sweet society of heavenly Powers,<br/>
Than this, . . a doleful scene,<br/>
Even in securest hours.<br/>
And whither would ye go?<br/>
Alas! can human or celestial ear,<br/>
Unmadden&rsquo;d, hear<br/>
The shrieks and yellings of infernal woe?<br/>
Can living flesh and blood<br/>
Endure the passage of the fiery flood?<br/>

<p class="stanza">8.</p>
Lord of the Gate, replied the Glendoveer,<br/>
We come obedient to the will of Fate;<br/>
And haply doom&rsquo;d to bring<br/>
Hope and salvation to the Infernal King,<br/>
For Seeva sends us here.<br/>
Even He to whom futurity is known,<br/>
The Holiest, bade us go to Yamen&rsquo;s throne.<br/>
Thou seest my precious charge;<br/>
Under thy care, secure from harm, I leave her,<br/>
While I ascend to bear her father down.<br/>
Beneath the shelter of thine arm receive her!<br/>

<p class="stanza">9.</p>
Then quoth he to the Maid,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{103}</span></p>
Be of good cheer, my Kailyal! dearest dear,<br/>
In faith subdue thy dread,<br/>
Anon I shall be here. So having said,<br/>
Aloft, with vigorous bound, the Glendoveer<br/>
Sprung in celestial might,<br/>
And soaring up, in spiral circles, wound<br/>
His indefatigable flight.<br/>

<p class="stanza">10.</p>
But, as he thus departed,<br/>
The Maid, who at Neroodi&rsquo;s feet was lying,<br/>
Like one entranced or dying,<br/>
Recovering strength from sudden terror, started;<br/>
And gazing after him with straining sight,<br/>
And straining arms, she stood,<br/>
As if in attitude<br/>
To win him back from flight.<br/>
Yea, she had shap&rsquo;d his name<br/>
For utterance, to recall and bid him stay,<br/>
Nor leave her thus alone; but virtuous shame<br/>
Represt the unbidden sounds upon their way;<br/>
And calling faith to aid,<br/>
Even in this fearful hour, the pious Maid<br/>
Collected courage, till she seem&rsquo;d to be<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{104}</span></p>
Calm and in hope, such power had piety.<br/>
Before the Giant Keeper of the Gate<br/>
She crost her patient arms, and at his feet,<br/>
Prepar&rsquo;d to meet<br/>
The awful will of Fate with equal mind,<br/>
She took her seat resign&rsquo;d.<br/>

<p class="stanza">11.</p>
Even the stern trouble of Neroodi&rsquo;s brow<br/>
Relax&rsquo;d as he beheld the valiant Maid.<br/>
Hope, long unfelt till now,<br/>
Rose in his heart reviving, and a smile<br/>
Dawn&rsquo;d in his brightening countenance, the while<br/>
He gaz&rsquo;d on her with wonder and delight.<br/>
The blessing of the Powers of Padalon,<br/>
Virgin, be on thee! cried the admiring God;<br/>
And blessed be the hour that gave thee birth,<br/>
Daughter of Earth,<br/>
For thou to this forlorn abode hast brought<br/>
Hope, who too long hath been a stranger here.<br/>
And surely for no lamentable lot,<br/>
Nature, who erreth not,<br/>
To thee that heart of fortitude hath given,<br/>
Those eyes of purity, that face of love: . .<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{105}</span></p>
If thou beest not the inheritrix of Heaven,<br/>
There is no truth above.<br/>

<p class="stanza">12.</p>
Thus as Neroodi spake, his brow severe<br/>
Shone with an inward joy; for sure he thought<br/>
When Seeva sent so fair a creature here,<br/>
In this momentous hour,<br/>
Ere long the World&rsquo;s deliverance would be wrought,<br/>
And Padalon escape the Rajah&rsquo;s power.<br/>
With pious mind the Maid, in humble guise<br/>
Inclin&rsquo;d, received his blessing silently,<br/>
And rais&rsquo;d her grateful eyes<br/>
A moment, then again<br/>
Abas&rsquo;d them at his presence. Hark! on high<br/>
The sound of coming wings! . . her anxious ears<br/>
Have caught the distant sound. Ereenia brings<br/>
His burthen down! Upstarting from her seat,<br/>
How joyfully she rears<br/>
Her eager head! and scarce upon the ground<br/>
Ladurlad&rsquo;s giddy feet their footing found,<br/>
When, with her trembling arms, she claspt him round.<br/>
No word of greeting,<br/>
Nor other sign of joy at that strange meeting.<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{106}</span></p>
Expectant of their fate,<br/>
Silent, and hand in hand,<br/>
Before the Infernal Gate,<br/>
The Father and his heavenly Daughter stand.<br/>

<p class="stanza">13.</p>
Then to Neroodi said the Glendoveer,<br/>
No Heaven-born Spirit e&rsquo;er hath visited<br/>
This region drear and dread; but I, the first<br/>
Who tread your World accurst.<br/>
Lord of the Gate, to whom these realms are known,<br/>
Direct our fated way to Yamen&rsquo;s throne.<br/>

<p class="stanza">14.</p>
Bring forth my Chariot, Carmala! quoth then<br/>
The Keeper of the way.<br/>
It was the Car wherein<br/>
On Yamen&rsquo;s festal day,<br/>
When all the Powers of Hell attend their King,<br/>
Yearly to Yamenpur did he repair<br/>
To pay his homage there.<br/>
Pois&rsquo;d on a single wheel, it mov&rsquo;d along,<br/>
Instinct with motion; by what wonderous skill<br/>
Compact, no human tongue could tell,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{107}</span></p>
Nor human wit devise; but on that wheel<br/>
Moving or still,<br/>
As if an inward life sustain&rsquo;d its weight,<br/>
Supported, stood the Car of miracle.<br/>

<p class="stanza">15.</p>
Then Carmala brought forth two mantles, white<br/>
As the swan&rsquo;s breast, and bright as mountain snow,<br/>
When from the wintry sky<br/>
The sun, late-rising, shines upon the height,<br/>
And rolling vapours fill the vale below.<br/>
Not without pain the unaccustom&rsquo;d sight<br/>
That brightness could sustain;<br/>
For neither mortal stain,<br/>
Nor parts corruptible, remain,<br/>
Nor aught that time could touch, or force destroy,<br/>
In that pure web whereof the robes were wrought;<br/>
So long had it in ten-fold fires been tried,<br/>
And blanch&rsquo;d, and to that brightness purified.<br/>
Apparel&rsquo;d thus, alone,<br/>
Children of Earth, Neroodi cried,<br/>
In safety may ye pass to Yamen&rsquo;s throne.<br/>
Thus only can your living flesh and blood<br/>
Endure the passage of the fiery flood.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{108}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">16.</p>
Of other frame, O Son of Heaven, art thou!<br/>
Yet hast thou now to go<br/>
Through regions which thy heavenly mould will try.<br/>
Glories unutterably bright, I know,<br/>
And beams intense of empyrean light,<br/>
Thine eye divine can bear: but fires of woe,<br/>
The sight of torments, and the cry<br/>
Of absolute despair,<br/>
Might not these things dismay thee on thy flight,<br/>
And thy strong pennons flag and fail thee there?<br/>
Trust not thy wings, celestial though thou art;<br/>
Nor thy good heart, which horror might assail<br/>
And pity quail,<br/>
Pity in these abodes of no avail;<br/>
But take thy seat this mortal pair beside,<br/>
And Carmala the infernal Car will guide.<br/>
Go, and may happy end your way betide!<br/>
So as he spake, the self-mov&rsquo;d Car roll&rsquo;d on,<br/>
And lo! they pass the Gate of Padalon.<br/>

PADALON.
</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">{109}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">1.</p>
Whoe&rsquo;er hath lov&rsquo;d with venturous step to tread<br/>
The chambers dread<br/>
Of some deep cave, and seen his taper&rsquo;s beam<br/>
Lost in the arch of darkness overhead,<br/>
And mark&rsquo;d its gleam,<br/>
Playing afar upon the sunless stream,<br/>
Where, from their secret bed,<br/>
And course unknown and inaccessible,<br/>
The silent waters well;<br/>
Whoe&rsquo;er hath trod such caves of endless night,<br/>
He knows, when measuring back the gloomy way,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{110}</span></p>
With what delight refresh&rsquo;d, his eye<br/>
Perceives the shadow of the light of day,<br/>
Through the far portal slanting, where it falls<br/>
Dimly reflected on the watry walls;<br/>
How heavenly seems the sky,<br/>
And how, with quicken&rsquo;d feet, he hastens up,<br/>
Eager again to greet<br/>
The living World, and blessed sunshine there,<br/>
And drink, as from a cup<br/>
Of joy, with thirsty lips, the open air.<br/>

<p class="stanza">2.</p>
Far other light than that of day there shone<br/>
Upon the travellers, entering Padalon.<br/>
They, too, in darkness entered on their way,<br/>
But, far before the Car,<br/>
A glow, as of a fiery furnace light,<br/>
Fill&rsquo;d all before them. &rsquo;Twas a light which made<br/>
Darkness itself appear<br/>
A thing of comfort, and the sight, dismay&rsquo;d,<br/>
Shrunk inward from the molten atmosphere.<br/>
Their way was through the adamantine rock<br/>
Which girt the World of Woe; on either side<br/>
Its massive walls arose, and overhead<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{111}</span></p>
Arch&rsquo;d the long passage; onward as they ride,<br/>
With stronger glare the light around them spread,<br/>
And lo! the regions dread,<br/>
The World of Woe before them, opening wide.<br/>

<p class="stanza">3.</p>
There rolls the fiery flood,<br/>
Girding the realms of Padalon around.<br/>
A sea of flame it seem&rsquo;d to be,<br/>
Sea without bound;<br/>
For neither mortal, nor immortal sight,<br/>
Could pierce across through that intensest light.<br/>
A single rib of steel,<br/>
Keen as the edge of keenest scymitar,<br/>
Spann&rsquo;d this wide gulph of fire. The infernal Car<br/>
Roll&rsquo;d to the Gulph, and on its single wheel<br/>
Self-balanced; rose upon that edge of steel.<br/>
Red-quivering float the vapours overhead;<br/>
The fiery gulph beneath them spread,<br/>
Tosses its billowing blaze with rush and roar;<br/>
Steady and swift the self-mov&rsquo;d Chariot went,<br/>
Winning the long ascent,<br/>
Then, downward rolling, gains the farther shore.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{112}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">4.</p>
But, oh! what sounds and sights of woe,<br/>
What sights and sounds of fear,<br/>
Assail the mortal travellers here!<br/>
Their way was on a causey straight and wide,<br/>
Where penal vaults on either side were seen,<br/>
Ranged like the cells wherein<br/>
Those wonderous winged alchemists infold<br/>
Their stores of liquid gold.<br/>
Thick walls of adamant divide<br/>
The dungeons; and from yonder circling flood,<br/>
Off-streams of fire through secret channels glide,<br/>
And wind among them, and in each provide<br/>
An everlasting food<br/>
Of righteous torments for the accursed brood.<br/>

<p class="stanza">5.</p>
These were the rebel race, who, in their might<br/>
Confiding impiously, would fain have driven<br/>
The Deities supreme from highest Heaven;<br/>
But by the Suras, in celestial fight,<br/>
Oppos&rsquo;d and put to flight,<br/>
Here, in their penal dens, the accursed crew,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{113}</span></p>
Not for its crime, but for its failure, rue<br/>
Their wild ambition. Yet again they long<br/>
The contest to renew,<br/>
And wield their arms again in happier hour;<br/>
And with united power,<br/>
Following Kehama&rsquo;s triumph, to press on<br/>
From World to World, and Heaven to Heaven, and Sphere<br/>
To Sphere, till Hemakoot shall be their own,<br/>
And Meru Mount, and Indra&rsquo;s Swerga-Bowers,<br/>
And Brama&rsquo;s region, where the heavenly Hours<br/>
Weave the vast circle of his age-long day.<br/>
Even over Veeshnoo&rsquo;s empyreal seat<br/>
They trust the Rajah shall extend their sway,<br/>
And that the seven-headed Snake, whereon<br/>
The strong Preserver sets his conquering feet,<br/>
Will rise and shake him headlong from his throne,<br/>
When, in their irresistible array,<br/>
Amid the Milky Sea they force their way.<br/>
Even higher yet their frantic thoughts aspire;<br/>
Yea, on their beds of torment as they lie,<br/>
The highest, holiest Seeva, they defy,<br/>
And tell him they shall have anon their day,<br/>
When they will storm his realm, and seize Mount Calasay.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{114}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">6.</p>
Such impious hopes torment<br/>
Their raging hearts, impious and impotent;<br/>
And now, with unendurable desire<br/>
And lust of vengeance, that, like inward fire,<br/>
Doth aggravate their punishment, they rave<br/>
Upon Kehama; him the accursed rout<br/>
Acclaim; with furious cries and maddening shout<br/>
They call on him to save;<br/>
Kehama! they exclaim;<br/>
Thundering, the dreadful echo rolls about,<br/>
And Hell&rsquo;s whole vault repeats Kehama&rsquo;s name.<br/>

<p class="stanza">7.</p>
Over these dens of punishment, the host<br/>
Of Padalon maintain eternal guard,<br/>
Keeping upon the walls their vigilant ward.<br/>
At every angle stood<br/>
A watch-tower, the decurion Demon&rsquo;s post,<br/>
Where, rais&rsquo;d on high, he view&rsquo;d with sleepless eye<br/>
His trust, that all was well. And over these,<br/>
Such was the perfect discipline of Hell,<br/>
Captains of fifties and of hundreds held<br/>
Authority, each in his loftier tower;<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{115}</span></p>
And chiefs of legions over them had power;<br/>
And thus all Hell with towers was girt around.<br/>
Aloft the brazen turrets shone<br/>
In the red light of Padalon,<br/>
And on the walls between,<br/>
Dark moving, the infernal Guards were seen,<br/>
Gigantic Demons pacing to and fro;<br/>
Who ever and anon,<br/>
Spreading their crimson pennons, plunged below,<br/>
Faster to rivet down the Asuras&rsquo; chains;<br/>
And with the snaky scourge and fiercer pains,<br/>
Repress their rage rebellious. Loud around,<br/>
In mingled sound, the echoing lash, the clash<br/>
Of chains, the ponderous hammer&rsquo;s iron stroke,<br/>
With execrations, groans, and shrieks and cries<br/>
Combin&rsquo;d, in one wild dissonance, arise;<br/>
And through the din there broke,<br/>
Like thunder heard through all the warring winds,<br/>
The dreadful name. Kehama, still they rave,<br/>
Hasten and save!<br/>
Now, now, Deliverer! now, Kehama, now!<br/>
Earthly Almighty, wherefore tarriest thou!<br/>

<p class="stanza">8.</p>
Oh, if that name abhorr&rsquo;d,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{116}</span></p>
Thus utter&rsquo;d, could well nigh<br/>
Dismay the Powers of Hell, and daunt their Lord,<br/>
How fearfully to Kailyal&rsquo;s ear it came!<br/>
She, as the Car roll&rsquo;d on its rapid way,<br/>
Bent down her head, and clos&rsquo;d her eyes for dread;<br/>
And deafening, with strong effort from within,<br/>
Her ears against the din,<br/>
Cover&rsquo;d and prest them close with both her hands.<br/>
Sure if the mortal Maiden had not fed<br/>
On heavenly food, and long been strengthened<br/>
With heavenly converse for such end vouchsaf&rsquo;d,<br/>
Her human heart had fail&rsquo;d, and she had died<br/>
Beneath the horrors of this awful hour.<br/>
But heaven supplied a power<br/>
Beyond her earthly nature, to the measure<br/>
Of need infusing strength;<br/>
And Fate, whose secret and unerring pleasure<br/>
Appointed all, decreed<br/>
An ample meed and recompence at length.<br/>
High-fated Maid, the righteous hour is nigh!<br/>
The all-embracing Eye<br/>
Of Retribution still beholdeth thee;<br/>
Bear onward to the end, O Maid, courageously!<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{117}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">9.</p>
On roll&rsquo;d the Car, and lo! afar<br/>
Upon its height the Towers of Yamenpur<br/>
Rise on the astonish&rsquo;d sight.<br/>
Behold the infernal City, Yamen&rsquo;s seat<br/>
Of empire, in the midst of Padalon,<br/>
Where the eight causeys meet.<br/>
There on a rock of adamant it stood,<br/>
Resplendent far and wide,<br/>
Itself of solid diamond edified,<br/>
And all around it roll&rsquo;d the fiery flood.<br/>
Eight bridges arch&rsquo;d the stream; huge piles of brass<br/>
Magnificent, such structures as beseem<br/>
The Seat and Capital of such great God,<br/>
Worthy of Yamen&rsquo;s own august abode.<br/>
A brazen tower and gateway at each end<br/>
Of each was rais&rsquo;d, where Giant Wardens stood,<br/>
Station&rsquo;d in arms the passage to defend,<br/>
That never foe might cross the fiery flood.<br/>

<p class="stanza">10.</p>
Oh what a gorgeous sight it was to see<br/>
The Diamond City blazing on its height<br/>
With more than mid-sun splendour, by the light<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{118}</span></p>
Of its own fiery river!<br/>
Its towers and domes and pinnacles and spires,<br/>
Turrets and battlements, that flash and quiver<br/>
Through the red restless atmosphere for ever.<br/>
And hovering over head,<br/>
The smoke and vapours of all Padalon,<br/>
Fit firmament for such a world, were spread,<br/>
With surge and swell, and everlasting motion,<br/>
Heaving and opening like tumultuous ocean.<br/>

<p class="stanza">11.</p>
Nor were there wanting there<br/>
Such glories as beseem&rsquo;d such region well;<br/>
For though with our blue heaven and genial air<br/>
The firmament of Hell might not compare,<br/>
As little might our earthly tempests vie<br/>
With the dread storms of that infernal sky,<br/>
Whose clouds of all metallic elements<br/>
Sublim&rsquo;d were full. For, when its thunder broke,<br/>
Not all the united World&rsquo;s artillery,<br/>
In one discharge, could equal that loud stroke;<br/>
And though the Diamond Towers and Battlements<br/>
Stood firm upon their adamantine rock,<br/>
Yet, while it vollied round the vault of Hell,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{119}</span></p>
Earth&rsquo;s solid arch was shaken with the shock,<br/>
And Cities in one mighty ruin fell.<br/>
Through the red sky terrific meteors scour;<br/>
Huge stones come hailing down; or sulphur-shower,<br/>
Floating amid the lurid air like snow,<br/>
Kindles in its descent,<br/>
And with blue fire-drops rains on all below.<br/>
At times the whole supernal element<br/>
Igniting, burst in one vast sheet of flame,<br/>
And roar&rsquo;d as with the sound<br/>
Of rushing winds, above, below, around;<br/>
Anon the flame was spent, and overhead<br/>
A heavy cloud of moving darkness spread.<br/>

<p class="stanza">12.</p>
Straight to the brazen bridge and gate<br/>
The self-mov&rsquo;d Chariot bears its mortal load.<br/>
At sight of Carmala,<br/>
On either side the Giant guards divide,<br/>
And give the chariot way.<br/>
Up yonder winding road it rolls along,<br/>
Swift as the bittern soars on spiral wing,<br/>
And lo! the Palace of the Infernal King!<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{120}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">13.</p>
Two forms inseparable in unity<br/>
Hath Yamen; even as with hope or fear<br/>
The Soul regardeth him doth he appear;<br/>
For hope and fear,<br/>
At that dread hour, from ominous conscience spring,<br/>
And err not in their bodings. Therefore some,<br/>
They who polluted with offences come,<br/>
Behold him as the King<br/>
Of Terrors, black of aspect, red of eye;<br/>
Reflecting back upon the sinful mind,<br/>
Heighten&rsquo;d with vengeance, and with wrath divine,<br/>
Its own inborn deformity.<br/>
But to the righteous Spirit how benign<br/>
His awful countenance,<br/>
Where, tempering justice with parental love,<br/>
Goodness and heavenly grace<br/>
And sweetest mercy shine! Yet is he still<br/>
Himself the same, one form, one face, one will;<br/>
And these his twofold aspects are but one;<br/>
And change is none<br/>
In him, for change in Yamen could not be,<br/>
The Immutable is he.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{121}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">14.</p>
He sate upon a marble sepulchre<br/>
Massive and huge, where, at the Monarch&rsquo;s feet,<br/>
The righteous Baly had his judgement-seat.<br/>
A Golden Throne before them vacant stood;<br/>
Three human forms sustain&rsquo;d its ponderous weight,<br/>
With lifted hands outspread, and shoulders bow&rsquo;d<br/>
Bending beneath their load.<br/>
A fourth was wanting. They were of the hue<br/>
Of coals of fire; yet were they flesh and blood,<br/>
And living breath they drew;<br/>
And their red eye-balls roll&rsquo;d with ghastly stare,<br/>
As thus, for their misdeeds, they stood tormented there.<br/>

<p class="stanza">15.</p>
On steps of gold those fiery Statues stood,<br/>
Who bore the Golden Throne. A cloud behind<br/>
Immoveable was spread; not all the light<br/>
Of all the flames and fires of Padalon<br/>
Could pierce its depth of night.<br/>
There Azyoruca veil&rsquo;d her awful form<br/>
In those eternal shadows: there she sate,<br/>
And as the trembling Souls, who crowd around<br/>
The Judgement-Seat, received the doom of fate,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{122}</span></p>
Her giant arms, extending from the cloud,<br/>
Drew them within the darkness. Moving out,<br/>
To grasp and bear away the innumerous rout,<br/>
For ever and for ever thus were seen<br/>
The thousand mighty arms of that dread Queen.<br/>

<p class="stanza">16.</p>
Here, issuing from the car, the Glendoveer<br/>
Did homage to the God, then rais&rsquo;d his head.<br/>
Suppliants we come, he said,<br/>
I need not tell thee by what wrongs opprest,<br/>
For nought can pass on earth to thee unknown;<br/>
Sufferers from tyranny we seek for rest,<br/>
And Seeva bade us go to Yamen&rsquo;s throne;<br/>
Here, he hath said, all wrongs shall be redrest.<br/>
Yamen replied, Even now the hour draws near,<br/>
When Fate its hidden ways will manifest.<br/>
Not for light purpose would the Wisest send<br/>
His suppliants here, when we, in doubt and fear,<br/>
The awful issue of the hour attend.<br/>
Wait ye in patience and in faith the end!<br/>

THE AMREETA.
</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">{123}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">1.</p>
So spake the King of Padalon, when, lo!<br/>
The voice of lamentation ceas&rsquo;d in Hell,<br/>
And sudden silence all around them fell,<br/>
Silence more wild and terrible<br/>
Than all the infernal dissonance before.<br/>
Through that portentous stillness, far away,<br/>
Unwonted sounds were heard, advancing on,<br/>
And deepening on their way;<br/>
For now the inexorable hour<br/>
Was come, and in the fullness of his power,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{124}</span></p>
Now that the dreadful rites had all been done,<br/>
Kehama from the Swerga hastened down,<br/>
To seize upon the throne of Padalon.<br/>

<p class="stanza">2.</p>
He came in all his might and majesty,<br/>
With all his terrors clad, and all his pride;<br/>
And, by the attribute of Deity,<br/>
Which he had won from Heaven, self-multiplied,<br/>
The dreadful One appear&rsquo;d on every side.<br/>
In the same indivisible point of time,<br/>
At the eight Gates he stood at once, and beat<br/>
The Warden-Gods of Hell beneath his feet;<br/>
Then, in his brazen Cars of triumph, straight,<br/>
At the same moment, drove through every gate.<br/>
By Aullays, hugest of created kind,<br/>
Fiercest, and fleeter than the viewless wind,<br/>
His Cars were drawn, ten yokes of ten abreast, . .<br/>
What less sufficed for such almighty weight?<br/>
Eight bridges from the fiery flood arose<br/>
Growing before his way; and on he goes,<br/>
And drives the thundering Chariot-wheels along,<br/>
At once o&rsquo;er all the roads of Padalon.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{125}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">3.</p>
Silent and motionless remain<br/>
The Asuras on their bed of pain,<br/>
Waiting, with breathless hope, the great event.<br/>
All Hell was hush&rsquo;d in dread,<br/>
Such awe that omnipresent coming spread;<br/>
Nor had its voice been heard, though all its rout<br/>
Innumerable had lifted up one shout;<br/>
Nor if the infernal firmament<br/>
Had, in one unimaginable burst,<br/>
Spent its collected thunders, had the sound<br/>
Been audible, such louder terrors went<br/>
Before his forms substantial. Round about<br/>
The presence scattered lightnings far and wide,<br/>
That quench&rsquo;d on every side,<br/>
With their intensest blaze, the feebler fire<br/>
Of Padalon, even as the stars go out,<br/>
When, with prodigious light,<br/>
Some blazing meteor fills the astonish&rsquo;d night.<br/>

<p class="stanza">4.</p>
The Diamond City shakes;<br/>
The adamantine Rock<br/>
Is loosen&rsquo;d with the shock;<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{126}</span></p>
From its foundation mov&rsquo;d, it heaves and quakes;<br/>
The brazen portals crumbling fall to dust;<br/>
Prone fall the Giant Guards<br/>
Beneath the Aullays crush&rsquo;d.<br/>
On, on, through Yamenpur, their thundering feet<br/>
Speed from all points to Yamen&rsquo;s judgement-seat.<br/>
And lo! where multiplied,<br/>
Behind, before him, and on every side,<br/>
Wielding all weapons in his countless hands,<br/>
Around the Lord of Hell Kehama stands!<br/>
Then, too, the Lord of Hell put forth his might:<br/>
Thick darkness, blacker than the blackest night,<br/>
Rose from their wrath, and veil&rsquo;d<br/>
The unutterable fight.<br/>
The power of Fate and Sacrifice prevail&rsquo;d,<br/>
And soon the strife was done.<br/>
Then did the Man-God re-assume<br/>
His unity, absorbing into one<br/>
The consubstantiate shapes; and as the gloom<br/>
Opened, fallen Yamen on the ground was seen,<br/>
His neck beneath the conquering Rajah&rsquo;s feet,<br/>
Who on the marble tomb<br/>
Had his triumphal seat.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{127}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">5.</p>
Silent the Man-Almighty sate; a smile<br/>
Gleam&rsquo;d on his dreadful lips, the while<br/>
Dallying with power, he paus&rsquo;d from following up<br/>
His conquest, as a man in social hour<br/>
Sips of the grateful cup,<br/>
Again and yet again, with curious taste,<br/>
Searching its subtle flavour ere he drink.<br/>
Even so Kehama now forbore his haste;<br/>
Having within his reach whate&rsquo;er he sought,<br/>
On his own haughty power he seem&rsquo;d to muse,<br/>
Pampering his arrogant heart with silent thought.<br/>
Before him stood the Golden Throne in sight,<br/>
Right opposite; he could not chuse but see,<br/>
Nor seeing chuse but wonder. Who are ye<br/>
Who bear the Golden Throne, tormented there?<br/>
He cried; for whom doth Destiny prepare<br/>
The imperial seat? and why are ye but Three?<br/>

<p class="spk">First Statue.</p>
I of the Children of Mankind was first,<br/>
Me miserable! who, adding store to store,<br/>
Heapt up superfluous wealth; and now accurst,<br/>
For ever I the frantic crime deplore.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{128}</span></p>

<p class="spk">Second Statue.</p>
I o&rsquo;er my Brethren of Mankind the first<br/>
Usurping power, set up a throne sublime,<br/>
A King and Conqueror: therefore thus accurst,<br/>
For ever I in vain repent the crime.<br/>

<p class="spk">Third Statue.</p>
I on the Children of Mankind the first,<br/>
In God&rsquo;s most holy name, impos&rsquo;d a tale<br/>
Of impious falsehood; therefore thus accurst,<br/>
For ever I in vain the crime bewail.<br/>

<p class="stanza">6.</p>
Even as thou here beholdest us,<br/>
Here we have stood, tormented thus,<br/>
Such countless ages, that they seem to be<br/>
Long as eternity,<br/>
And still we are but Three.<br/>
A Fourth will come to share<br/>
Our pain, at yonder vacant corner bear<br/>
His portion of the burthen, and compleat<br/>
The golden Throne for Yamen&rsquo;s judgement-seat.<br/>
Thus hath it been appointed: he must be<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{129}</span></p>
Equal in guilt to us, the guilty Three.<br/>
Kehama, come! too long we wait for thee!<br/>

<p class="stanza">7.</p>
Thereat, with one accord,<br/>
The Three took up the word, like choral song,<br/>
Come, Rajah! Man-God! Earth&rsquo;s Almighty Lord!<br/>
Kehama, come! we wait for thee too long.<br/>

<p class="stanza">8.</p>
A short and sudden laugh of wondering pride<br/>
Burst from him in his triumph: to reply<br/>
Scornful he deign&rsquo;d not; but with alter&rsquo;d eye,<br/>
Wherein some doubtful meaning seem&rsquo;d to lie,<br/>
He turn&rsquo;d to Kailyal. Maiden, thus he cried,<br/>
I need not bid thee see<br/>
How vain it is to strive with Fate&rsquo;s decree,<br/>
When hither thou hast fled to fly from me,<br/>
And lo! even here thou find&rsquo;st me at thy side.<br/>
Mine thou must be, being doom&rsquo;d with me to share<br/>
The Amreeta-cup of immortality;<br/>
Yea, by Myself I swear<br/>
It hath been thus appointed. Joyfully<br/>
Join then thy hand and heart and will with mine,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{130}</span></p>
Nor at such glorious destiny repine,<br/>
Nor in thy folly more provoke my wrath divine.<br/>

<p class="stanza">9.</p>
She answer&rsquo;d; I have said. It must not be!<br/>
Almighty as thou art,<br/>
Thou hast put all things underneath thy feet,<br/>
But still the resolute heart<br/>
And virtuous will are free.<br/>
Never, oh! never, . . never . . can there be<br/>
Communion, Rajah, between thee and me.<br/>

<p class="stanza">10.</p>
Once more, quoth he, I urge, and once alone.<br/>
Thou seest yon Golden Throne,<br/>
Where I anon shall set thee by my side;<br/>
Take thou thy seat thereon,<br/>
Kehama&rsquo;s willing bride,<br/>
And I will place the Kingdoms of the World<br/>
Beneath thy Father&rsquo;s feet,<br/>
Appointing him the King of mortal men:<br/>
Else underneath that Throne,<br/>
The Fourth supporter, he shall stand and groan;<br/>
Prayers will be vain to move my mercy then.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{131}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">11.</p>
Again the Virgin answer&rsquo;d, I have said!<br/>
Ladurlad caught her in his proud embrace,<br/>
While on his neck she hid<br/>
In agony her face.<br/>

<p class="stanza">12.</p>
Bring forth the Amreeta-cup! Kehama cried<br/>
To Yamen, rising sternly in his pride.<br/>
It is within the Marble Sepulchre,<br/>
The vanquish&rsquo;d Lord of Padalon replied,<br/>
Bid it be opened. . . . Give thy treasure up!<br/>
Exclaim&rsquo;d the Man-Almighty to the Tomb.<br/>
And at his voice and look<br/>
The massy fabric shook, and opened wide.<br/>
A huge Anatomy was seen reclin&rsquo;d<br/>
Within its marble womb. Give me the Cup!<br/>
Again Kehama cried; no other charm<br/>
Was needed than that voice of stern command.<br/>
From his repose the ghastly form arose,<br/>
Put forth his bony and gigantic arm,<br/>
And gave the Amreeta to the Rajah&rsquo;s hand.<br/>
Take! drink! with accents dread the Spectre said,<br/>
For thee and Kailyal hath it been assign&rsquo;d,<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{132}</span></p>
Ye only of the Children of Mankind.<br/>

<p class="stanza">13.</p>
Then was the Man-Almighty&rsquo;s heart elate;<br/>
This is the consummation! he exclaim&rsquo;d,<br/>
Thus have I triumphed over Death and Fate.<br/>
Now, Seeva! look to thine abode!<br/>
Henceforth, on equal footing we engage,<br/>
Alike immortal now, and we will wage<br/>
Our warfare, God to God!<br/>
Joy fill&rsquo;d his impious soul,<br/>
And to his lips he rais&rsquo;d the fatal bowl.<br/>

<p class="stanza">14.</p>
Thus long the Glendoveer had stood,<br/>
Watching the wonders of the eventful hour,<br/>
Amaz&rsquo;d but undismay&rsquo;d; for in his heart<br/>
Faith, overcoming fear, maintain&rsquo;d its power.<br/>
Nor had that faith abated, when the God<br/>
Of Padalon was beaten down in fight;<br/>
For then he look&rsquo;d to see the heavenly might<br/>
Of Seeva break upon them. But when now<br/>
He saw the Amreeta in Kehama&rsquo;s hand,<br/>
An impulse which denied all self-command<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{133}</span></p>
In that extremity<br/>
Stung him, and he resolved to seize the cup,<br/>
And dare the Rajah&rsquo;s force in Seeva&rsquo;s sight.<br/>
Forward he sprung to tempt the unequal fray,<br/>
When lo! the Anatomy,<br/>
With warning arm, withstood his desperate way,<br/>
And from the Golden Throne the fiery Three<br/>
Again, in one accord, renew&rsquo;d their song,<br/>
Kehama, come! we wait for thee too long.<br/>

<p class="stanza">15.</p>
O fool of drunken hope and frantic vice!<br/>
Madman! to seek for power beyond thy scope<br/>
Of knowledge, and to deem<br/>
Less than omniscience could suffice<br/>
To wield omnipotence! O fool, to dream<br/>
That immortality could be<br/>
The meed of evil! . . yea thou hast it now,<br/>
Victim of thine own wicked heart&rsquo;s device,<br/>
Thou hast thine object now, and now must pay the price.<br/>

<p class="stanza">16.</p>
He did not know the awful mystery<br/>
Of that divinest cup, that as the lips<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{134}</span></p>
Which touch it, even such its quality,<br/>
Good or malignant: Madman! and he thinks<br/>
The blessed prize is won, and joyfully he drinks.<br/>

<p class="stanza">17.</p>
Then Seeva opened on the Accursed One<br/>
His Eye of Anger: upon him alone<br/>
The wrath-beam fell. He shudders . . . but too late;<br/>
The deed is done,<br/>
The dreadful liquor works the will of Fate.<br/>
Immortal he would be,<br/>
Immortal he remains; but through his veins<br/>
Torture at once and immortality,<br/>
A stream of poison doth the Amreeta run,<br/>
Infinite everlasting agony.<br/>
And while within the burning anguish flows,<br/>
His outward body glows<br/>
Like molten ore beneath the avenging eye,<br/>
Doom&rsquo;d thus to live and burn eternally.<br/>
The fiery Three,<br/>
Beholding him, set up a fiendish cry,<br/>
A song of jubilee:<br/>
Come, Brother, come! they sung; too long<br/>
We in our torments have expected thee;<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{135}</span></p>
Come, Brother, come! henceforth we bear no more<br/>
The unequal weight; Come, Brother, we are Four!<br/>

<p class="stanza">18.</p>
Vain his almightiness, for mightier pain<br/>
Subdued all power; pain ruled supreme alone.<br/>
And yielding to the bony hand<br/>
The unemptied cup, he mov&rsquo;d toward the throne,<br/>
And at the vacant corner took his stand.<br/>
Behold the Golden Throne at length compleat,<br/>
And Yamen silently ascends the Judgement-Seat.<br/>

<p class="stanza">19.</p>
For two alone, of all mankind, to me<br/>
The Amreeta-Cup was given,<br/>
Then said the Anatomy;<br/>
The Man hath drank, the Woman&rsquo;s turn is next.<br/>
Come, Kailyal, come, receive thy doom,<br/>
And do the Will of Heaven! . .<br/>
Wonder, and Fear, and Awe at once perplext<br/>
The mortal Maiden&rsquo;s heart, but over all<br/>
Hope rose triumphant. With a trembling hand,<br/>
Obedient to his call,<br/>
She took the fated Cup; and, lifting up<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{136}</span></p>
Her eyes, where holy tears began to swell,<br/>
Is it not your command,<br/>
Ye heavenly Powers? as on her knees she fell,<br/>
The pious Virgin cried;<br/>
Ye know my innocent will, my heart sincere,<br/>
Ye govern all things still,<br/>
And wherefore should I fear!<br/>

<p class="stanza">20.</p>
She said, and drank. The Eye of Mercy beam&rsquo;d<br/>
Upon the Maid: a cloud of fragrance steam&rsquo;d<br/>
Like incense-smoke, as all her mortal frame<br/>
Dissolved beneath the potent agency<br/>
Of that mysterious draught; such quality,<br/>
From her pure touch, the fated Cup partook.<br/>
Like one entranced she knelt,<br/>
Feeling her body melt<br/>
Till all but what was heavenly past away:<br/>
Yet still she felt<br/>
Her spirit strong within her, the same heart,<br/>
With the same loves, and all her heavenly part,<br/>
Unchanged, and ripen&rsquo;d to such perfect state,<br/>
In this miraculous birth, as here on Earth,<br/>
Dimly our holiest hopes anticipate.<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum">{137}</span></p>

<p class="stanza">21.</p>
Mine! mine! with rapturous joy Ereenia cried,<br/>
Immortal now, and yet not more divine;<br/>
Mine, mine. . . for ever mine!<br/>
The immortal Maid replied,<br/>
For ever, ever, thine!<br/>

<p class="stanza">22.</p>
Then Yamen said, O thou to whom, by Fate,<br/>
Alone of all mankind, this lot is given,<br/>
Daughter of Earth, but now the Child of Heaven<br/>
Go with thy heavenly Mate,<br/>
Partaker now of his immortal bliss;<br/>
Go to the Swerga Bowers,<br/>
And there recall the hours<br/>
Of endless happiness.<br/>

<p class="stanza">23.</p>
But that sweet Angel, for she still retain&rsquo;d<br/>
Her human loves and human piety,<br/>
As if reluctant at the God&rsquo;s commands,<br/>
Linger&rsquo;d, with anxious eye<br/>
Upon her father fix&rsquo;d, and spread her hands<br/>
Toward him wistfully.<br/>
<p><span class="pagenum">{138}</span></p>
Go! Yamen cried, nor cast that look behind<br/>
Upon Ladurlad at this parting hour,<br/>
For thou shalt find him in thy Mother&rsquo;s Bower.<br/>

<p class="stanza">24.</p>
The Car, as Carmala his word obey&rsquo;d,<br/>
Mov&rsquo;d on, and bore away the Maid,<br/>
While from the Golden Throne the Lord of Death<br/>
With love benignant, on Ladurlad smil&rsquo;d,<br/>
And gently on his head his blessing laid.<br/>
As sweetly as a child,<br/>
Whom neither thought disturbs nor care encumbers,<br/>
Tir&rsquo;d with long play, at close of summer day,<br/>
Lies down and slumbers,<br/>
Even thus as sweet a boon of sleep partaking,<br/>
By Yamen blest, Ladurlad sunk to rest.<br/>
Blessed that sleep! more blessed was the waking!<br/>
For on that night a heavenly morning broke,<br/>
The light of heaven was round him when he woke,<br/>
And in the Swerga, in Yedillian&rsquo;s Bower,<br/>
All whom he lov&rsquo;d he met, to part no more.<br/>

<div class="note_head">
<i>The Banian Tree.</i>&mdash;XIII. p. 4.
</div>

<p>
The <i>Burghut</i>, or Banian, often measures from twenty-four to thirty feet
in girth. It is distinguished from every other tree hitherto known, by
the very peculiar circumstance of throwing out roots from all its
branches. These, being pendant, and perfectly lax, in time reach the
ground, which they penetrate, and ultimately become substantial props to
the very massy horizontal boughs, which, but for such a support, must
either be stopt in their growth, or give way, from their own weight.
Many of these <i>quondam</i> roots, changing their outward appearance from a
brown rough rind to a regular bark, not unlike that of the beech,
increase to a great diameter. They may be often seen from four to five
feet in circumference, and <span class="pagenum">{142}</span> in a true perpendicular line. An
observer, ignorant of their nature, might think them artificial, and
that they had been placed for the purpose of sustaining the boughs from
which they originated. They proceed from all the branches
indiscriminately, whether near or far removed from the ground. They
appear like new swabs, such as are in use on board ships: however, few
reach sufficiently low to take a hold of the soil, except those of the
lower branches. I have seen some do so from a great height, but they
were thin, and did not promise well. Many of the ramifications pendant
from the higher boughs are seen to turn round the lower branches, but
without any obvious effect on either; possibly, however, they may derive
sustenance, even from that partial mode of communication. The height of
a full-grown Banian may be from sixty to eighty feet; and many of them,
I am fully confident, cover at least two acres. Their leaves are similar
to, but rather larger than those of the laurel. The wood of the trunk is
used only for fuel; it is light and brittle; but the pillars formed by
the roots are valuable, being extremely elastic and light, working with
ease, and possessing great toughness: it resembles a good kind of
ash.&mdash;<i>Oriental Field Sports</i>, vol. ii. p. 113.

&mdash;&mdash;<i>The Well</i><br/>
<i>Which they, with sacrifice of rural pride,</i><br/>
<i>Have wedded to the Cocoa-Grove beside.</i>&mdash;XIII. p. 5.
</div>

<p>
It is a general practice, that, when a plantation is made, a well should
be dug at one of its sides. The well and the tope are married; a
ceremony at which all the village attends, and in which often much money
is expended. The well is considered as the husband, as its waters, which
are copiously furnished to the young trees during the first hot season,
are supposed to cherish and impregnate them. Though vanity and
superstition are evidently the basis of these institutions, yet we
cannot help admiring their effects, so beautifully ornamenting a torrid
country, and affording such general convenience.&mdash;<i>Oriental Sports</i>, p.
10.
</p>


<div class="note_head">
<i>Tanks.</i>&mdash;XIII. p. 5.
</div>

<p>
Some of these tanks are of very great extent, often covering eight or
ten acres; and, besides having steps of masonry, perhaps fifty or sixty
feet in breadth, are faced with brick-work, plastered in the most
substantial manner. The corners are generally ornamented with round or
polygon pavilions of a neat appearance.&mdash;<i>Oriental Sports</i>, vol. ii. p.
116.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{144}</span></p>

<p>
There are two kinds of tanks, which we confound under one common name,
though nothing can be more different. The first is the <i>Eray</i>, which is
formed by throwing a mound or bank across a valley or hollow ground, so
that the rain water collects in the upper part of the valley, and is let
out on the lower part by sluices, for the purposes of cultivation. The
other kind is the <i>Culam</i>, which is formed by digging out the earth, and
is destined for supplying the inhabitants with water for domestic
purposes. The <i>Culams</i> are very frequently lined on all the four sides
with cut stone, and are the most elegant works of the
natives.&mdash;<span class="sc">Buchanan</span>.
</p>

<p>
Where there are no springs or rivers to furnish them with water, as it
is in the northern parts, where there are but two or three springs, they
supply this defect by saving of rain water; which they do by casting up
great banks in convenient places, to stop and contain the rains that
fall, and so save it till they have occasion to let it out into the
fields: They are made rounding, like a C, or half-moon. Every town has
one of these ponds, which, if they can get but filled with water, they
count their corn is as good as in the barn. It was no small work to the
ancient inhabitants to make all these banks, of which there is a great
number, being some two, some three fathoms in height, and in length some
above a mile, some <span class="pagenum">{145}</span> less, not all of a size. They are now grown
over with great trees, and so seem natural hills. When they would use
the water, they cut a gap in one end of the bank, and so draw the water
by little and little, as they have occasion, for the watering their
corn.
</p>

<p>
These ponds, in dry weather, dry up quite. If they should dig these
ponds deep, it would not be so convenient for them. It would indeed
contain the water well, but would not so well, nor in such plenty, empty
out itself into their grounds. In these ponds are alligators, which,
when the water is dried up, depart into the woods, and down to the
rivers, and, in the time of rains, come up again into the ponds. They
are but small, nor do use to catch people, nevertheless they stand in
some fear of them.
</p>

<p>
The corn they sow in these parts is of that sort that is soonest ripe,
fearing lest their waters should fail. As the water dries out of these
ponds, they make use of them for fields, treading the mud with
buffaloes, and then sowing rice thereon, and frequently casting up water
with scoops on it.&mdash;<span class="sc">Knox</span>, p. 9.
</p>


<div class="note_head">
<i>The Lotus.</i>&mdash;XIII. p. 5.
</div>

<p>
The lotus abounds in the numerous lakes and ponds of the province of
Garah; and we had the pleasure of comparing <span class="pagenum">{146}</span> several varieties;
single and full, white, and tinged with deep or with faint tints of red.
To a near view, the simple elegance of the white lotus gains no
accession of beauty from the multiplication of its petals, nor from the
tinge of gaudy hue; but the richest tint is most pleasing, when a lake,
covered with full-blown lotas, is contemplated.&mdash;<i>Journey from Mirzapur
to Nagpur</i>.&mdash;Asiatic Annual Register, 1806.

<div class="note_head">
<i>They built them up a Bower, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;XIII. p. 5.
</div>

<p>
The materials of which these houses are made are always easy to be
procured, and the structure is so simple, that a spacious, and by no
means uncomfortable dwelling, suited to the climate, may be erected in
one day. Our habitation, consisting of three small rooms, and a hall
open to the north, in little more than four hours was in readiness for
our reception; fifty or sixty labourers completed it in that time, and
on emergency could perform the work in much less. Bamboos, grass for
thatching, and the ground rattan, are all the materials requisite: not a
nail is used in the whole edifice: A row of strong bamboos, from eight
to ten feet high, are fixed firm in the ground, which describe the
outline, and are the supporters of the building: smaller bamboos are
then tied horizontally, by strips of the ground rattan, to these upright
posts: <span class="pagenum">{147}</span> The walls, composed of bamboo mats, are fastened to the
sides with similar ligatures: bamboo rafters are quickly raised, and a
roof formed, over which thatch is spread in regular layers, and bound to
the roof by filaments of rattan. A floor of bamboo grating is next laid
in the inside, elevated two or three feet above the ground: this grating
is supported on bamboos, and covered with mats and carpets. Thus ends
the process, which is not more simple than effectual. When the workmen
take pains, a house of this sort is proof against very inclement

In this district the long grass called jungle is more prevalent than I
ever yet noticed. It rises to the height of seven or eight feet, and is
topped with a beautiful white down, resembling a swan&rsquo;s feather. It is
the mantle with which nature here covers all the uncultivated ground,
and at once veils the indolence of the people and the nakedness <span class="pagenum">{148}</span> of
their land. It has a fine shewy appearance, as it undulates in the wind,
like the waves of the sea. Nothing but the want of greater variety to
its colour prevents it from being one of the finest and most beautiful
objects in that rich store of productions with which nature
spontaneously supplies the improvident natives.&mdash;<span class="sc">Tennant</span>.

The Hindoos are enjoined by the <i>Veds</i> to offer a cake, which is called

generation. This ceremony is performed on the day of the new moon in
every month. The offering of water is in like manner commanded to be
performed daily; and this ceremony is called <i>Tarpan</i>, to satisfy, to
appease. The souls of such men as have left children to continue their
generation, are supposed to be transported, immediately upon quitting
their bodies, into a certain region called the <i>Peetree Log</i>, where they
may continue in proportion to their former virtues, provided these
ceremonies be not neglected; otherwise they are precipitated into
<i>Nark</i>, and doomed to be born again in the bodies of unclean beasts; and
until, by repeated <span class="pagenum">{149}</span> regenerations, all their sins are done away,

The <i>Surput</i>, or tassel-grass, which is much the same as the
guinea-grass, grows to the height of twelve or fourteen feet. Its stem
becomes so thick as to resemble in some measure a reed. It is very
strong, and grows very luxuriantly: it is even used as a fence against
cattle; for which purpose it is often planted on banks, excavated from
ditches, to enclose fields of corn, &amp;c. It grows wild in all the
uncultivated parts of India, but especially in the <span class="pagenum">{150}</span> lower
provinces, in which it occupies immense tracts; sometimes mixing with,
and rising above coppices; affording an asylum for elephants,
rhinoceroses, tygers, &amp;c. It frequently is laid by high winds, of which
breeding sows fail not to take advantage, by forming their nests, and
concealing their young under the prostrate grass.&mdash;<i>Oriental Sports</i>,

Nature has provided the elephant with means to cool its heated surface,

The Hindoo poets frequently allude to the fragrant juice which oozes, at
certain seasons, from small ducts <span class="pagenum">{151}</span> in the temples of the male
elephant, and is useful in relieving him from the redundant moisture,
with which he is then oppressed; and they even describe the bees as
allured by the scent, and mistaking it for that of the sweetest flowers.
When Crishna visited Sanc&rsquo;ha-dwip, and had destroyed the demon who
infested that delightful country, he passed along the bank of a river,
and was charmed with a delicious odour, which its waters diffused in
their course: He was eager to view the source of so fragrant a stream,
but was informed by the natives that it flowed from the temples of an
elephant, immensely large, milk-white, and beautifully formed; that he
governed a numerous race of elephants; and that the odoriferous fluid
which exuded from his temples in the season of love had formed the
river; that the Devas, or inferior gods, and the Apsarases, or nymphs,
bathed and sported in its waters, impassioned and intoxicated with the
liquid perfume.&mdash;<span class="sc">Wilford</span>. <i>Asiatic Researches</i>.

I have been assured, by a credible eye-witness, that two wild antelopes
used often to come from their woods to the place where a more savage
beast, Sirajuddaulah, entertained himself with concerts, and that they
listened to the strains with an appearance of pleasure, till the
monster, in whose soul there was no music, shot one of them, to display
his archery. A learned native of this country told me that he had
frequently seen the most venomous and malignant snakes leave their
holes, upon hearing tunes on a flute, which, as he supposed, gave them
peculiar delight. An intelligent Persian, who repeated his story again

had more than once been present when a celebrated lutanist, <i>Mirza

This temple is to the Hindoos what Mecca is to the Mahommedans. It is

seat of Brahminical power, and a strong-hold of their superstition. At
the <span class="pagenum">{158}</span> annual festival of the Butt Jattra, seven hundred thousand
persons (as has been computed by the Pundits in College) assemble at
this place. The number of deaths in a single year, caused by voluntary
devotement, by imprisonment for non-payment of the demands of the
Brahmins, or by the scarcity of provisions for such a multitude, is
incredible. The precincts of the place are covered with

Many thousands of people are employed in carrying water from Hurdwar to

superstitious notion is the cause of as much lost labour as would long
since have converted the largest province of Asia into a garden. The
numbers thus employed are immense; they travel with two flasks of the
water slung over the shoulder by means of an elastic piece of bamboo.
The same quantity which employs, perhaps, fifteen thousand persons,
might easily be carried down the Ganges in a few boats annually. Princes
and families of distinction have this water carried to them in all parts

and those sayings in that text are herein truly accomplished in the

The chariot is most richly adorned with most rich and costly ornaments;
and the aforesaid wheels are placed very complete in a round circle, so

There are in India common women, called Wives of the Idol. When a woman
has made a vow to obtain children, if she brings into the world a
beautiful daughter, she carries her to <i>Bod</i>, so their idol is called,
with whom she leaves her. This girl, when she is arrived at a proper
age, takes an apartment in the public place, hangs a curtain before the
door, and waits for those who are passing, as well Indians as those of
other sects among whom this debauchery is permitted. She prostitutes
<span class="pagenum">{162}</span> herself for a certain price, and all that she can thus acquire she
carries to the priest of the idol, that he may apply it to the service
of the temple. Let us, says the Mohammedan relater, bless the almighty
and glorious God, that he has chosen us, to exempt us from all the
crimes into which men are led by their unbelief.&mdash;<i>Anciennes Relations</i>.
</p>

<p>
Incited, unquestionably, says Mr. Maurice, by the hieroglyphic emblem of
vice so conspicuously elevated, and so strikingly painted in the temples
of Mahadeo, the priests of that deity industriously selected the most
beautiful females that could be found, and, in their tenderest years,
with great pomp and solemnity, consecrated them (as it is impiously
called) to the service of the presiding divinity of the pagoda. They
were trained up in every art to delude and to delight; and, to the
fascination of external beauty, their artful betrayers added the
attractions arising from mental accomplishments. Thus was an invariable
rule of the Hindoos, <i>that women have no concern with literature</i>,
dispensed with upon this infamous occasion. The moment these hapless
victims reached maturity, they fell victims to the lust of the Brahmins.
They were early taught to practise the most alluring blandishments, to
roll the expressive eye of wanton pleasure, and to invite to criminal
indulgence, by <span class="pagenum">{163}</span> stealing upon the beholder the tender look of
voluptuous languishing. They were instructed to mould their elegant and
airy forms into the most enticing attitudes and the most lascivious
gestures, while the rapid and graceful motion of their feet, adorned
with golden bells, and glittering with jewels, kept unison with the
exquisite melody of their voices. Every pagoda has a band of these young
syrens, whose business, on great festivals, is to dance in public before
the idol, to sing hymns in his honour, and in private to enrich the
treasury of that pagoda with the wages of prostitution. These women are
not, however, regarded in a dishonourable light; they are considered as
<i>wedded to the idol</i>, and they partake of the veneration paid to him.
They are forbidden even to desert the pagoda where they are educated,
and are never permitted to marry; but the offspring, if any, of their
criminal embraces are considered as sacred to the idol: the boys are
taught to play on the sacred instruments used at the festivals, and the
daughters are devoted to the abandoned occupations of their
mothers.&mdash;<i>Indian Antiquities</i>.

These impostors take a young maid, of the fairest they can meet with, to

<span class="pagenum">{164}</span> have carried her) with the idol, making her believe that
<i>Jagannat</i> himself will come and embrace her, and appointing her to ask
him, whether it will be a fruitful year, what kind of processions,
feasts, prayers, and alms he demands to be made for it. In the mean time
one of these lustful priests enters at night by a little back-door into
the temple, deflowereth this young maid, and maketh her believe any
thing he pleaseth; and the next day, being transported from this temple
into another with the same magnificence, she was carried before upon the
chariot of triumph, on the side of <i>Jagannat</i> her bridegroom: these

The fifth incarnation was in a Bramin dwarf, under the name of Vamen; it

true to his word, compassionate, and charitable. Vichenou, under the
form of a very little Bramin, presented himself before him while he was
sacrificing, and asked him for three paces of land to build a hut. Baly
ridiculed the <span class="pagenum">{165}</span> apparent imbecility of the dwarf, in telling him,
that he ought not to limit his demand to a bequest so trifling; that his
generosity could bestow a much larger donation of land. Vamen answered,
That, being of so small a stature, what he asked was more than
sufficient. The prince immediately granted his request, and, to ratify
his donation, poured water into his right hand; which was no sooner done
than the dwarf grew so prodigiously, that his body filled the universe!
He measured the earth with one pace, and the heavens with another, and
then summoned Baly to give him his word for the third. The prince then
recognised Vichenou, adored him, and presented his head to him; but the
god, satisfied with his submission, sent him to govern the Padalon, and

attention on approaching the place; for as it rises abruptly out of a
level plain of great extent, consists chiefly of one single stone, and
is situated very near to the sea-beach, it is such a kind of object as
an inquisitive traveller would naturally turn aside to examine. Its
shape is also singular and romantic, and, from a distant view, has an
appearance like some antique and lofty edifice. On coming near to the
foot of the rock from the north, works of imagery and sculpture crowd so
thick upon the eye, as might seem to favour the idea of <span class="pagenum">{167}</span> a
petrified town, like those that have been fabled in different parts of
the world, by too credulous travellers. Proceeding on by the foot of the
hill, on the side facing the sea, there is a pagoda rising out of the
ground, of one solid stone, about sixteen or eighteen feet high, which
seems to have been cut upon the spot, out of a detached rock, that has
been found of a proper size for that purpose. The top is arched, and the
style of architecture according to which it is formed different from any
now used in those parts. A little further on, there appears, upon a huge
surface of stone, that juts out a little from the side of the hill, a
numerous group of human figures, in bass-relief, considerably larger
than life, representing the most remarkable persons whose actions are
celebrated in the Nahâbharit, each of them in an attitude, or with
weapons, or other insignia, expressive of his character, or of some one
of his most famous exploits. All these figures are doubtless much less
distinct than they were at first; for upon comparing these and the rest
of the sculptures that are exposed to the sea-air, with others at the
same place, whose situation has afforded them protection from that
element, the difference is striking; the former being every where much
defaced, while the others are fresh as recently finished. An excavation
in another part of the east side of the great rock appears <span class="pagenum">{168}</span> to have
been made on the same plan, and for the same purpose, that Chowltries
are usually built in that country, that is to say, for the accommodation
of travellers. The rock is hollowed out to the size of a spacious room,
and two or three rows of pillars are left, as a seeming support to the
mountainous mass of stone which forms the roof.
</p>

<p>
The ascent of the hill on the north is, from its natural shape, gradual
and easy at first, and is in other parts rendered more so, by very
excellent steps, cut out in several places where the communication would
be difficult or impracticable without them. A winding stair of this sort
leads to a kind of temple cut out of the solid rock, with some figures
of idols in high relief upon the walls, very well finished. From this
temple there are flights of steps, that seem to have led to some edifice
formerly standing upon the hill; nor does it seem absurd to suppose that
this may have been a palace, to which this temple may have appertained;
for, besides the small detached range of stairs that are here and there
cut in the rock, and seem as if they had once led to different parts of
one great building, there appear in many places small water channels cut
also in the rock, as if for drains to an house; and the whole top of the
hill is strewed with small round pieces of brick, which may be supposed,
<span class="pagenum">{169}</span> from their appearance, to have been worn down to their present
form during the lapse of many ages. On a plain surface of the rock,
which may once have served as the floor of some apartment, there is a
platform of stone, about 8 or 9 feet long, by 3 or 4 wide, in a
situation rather elevated, with two or three steps leading up to it,
perfectly resembling a couch or bed, and a lion very well executed at
the upper end of it, by way of pillow; the whole of one piece, being
part of the hill itself. This the Bramins, inhabitants of the place,
call the bed of Dhermarâjah, or Judishter, the eldest of the five
brothers, whose exploits are the leading subject in the Mahabhârit. And
at a considerable distance from this, at such a distance, indeed, as the
apartments of the women might be supposed to be from that of the men, is
a bath, excavated also from the rock, with steps in the inside, which
the Bramins call the Bath of Dropedy, the wife of Judishter and his
brothers. How much credit is due to this tradition, and whether this
stone couch may not have been anciently used as a kind of throne, rather
than a bed, is matter for future enquiry. A circumstance, however, which
may seem to favour this idea is, that a throne, in the Shanscrit and
other Hindoo languages, is called <i>Singhâsen</i>, which is compounded of
<i>Sing</i>, a lion, and <i>ásen</i>, a seat.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{170}</span></p>

<p>
But though these works may be deemed stupendous, they are surpassed by
others that are to be seen at the distance of about a mile, or mile and
half, to the south of the hill. They consist of two pagodas, of about
30 feet long, by 20 feet wide, and about as many in height, cut out of
the solid rock, and each consisting originally of one single stone.
Their form is different from the style of architecture according to
which idol temples are now built in that country. These sculptures
approach nearer to the Gothic taste, being surmounted by arched roofs,
or domes, not semicircular, but composed of two segments of circles
meeting in a point at top. Near these also stand an elephant full as big
as life, and a lion much larger than the natural size, both hewn also
out of one stone.
</p>

<p>
The great rock is about 50 or 100 yards from the sea; but close to the
sea are the remains of a pagoda built of brick, and dedicated to Sîb,
the greatest part of which has evidently been swallowed up by that
element; for the door of the innermost apartment, in which the idol is
placed, and before which there are always two or three spacious courts
surrounded with walls, is now washed by the waves, and the pillar used
to discover the meridian at the time of founding the pagoda is seen
standing at some distance in the sea. In the neighbourhood of <span class="pagenum">{171}</span> this
building there are some detached rocks, washed also by the waves, on
which there appear sculptures, though now much worn and defaced: And the
natives of the place declared to the writer of this account, that the
more aged people among them remembered to have seen the tops of several
pagodas far out in the sea, which, being covered with copper, (probably
gilt,) were particularly visible at sun-rise, as their shining surface
used then to reflect the sun&rsquo;s rays, but that now that effect was no
longer produced, as the copper had since become incrusted with mould and
verdigrease.&mdash;<span class="sc">Chambers</span>. <i>Asiatic Researches</i>.

Malecheren, (which is probably another name for Baly), in an excursion
which he made one day alone, and in <span class="pagenum">{173}</span> disguise, came to a garden in
the environs of his city Mahâbalipoor, where was a fountain so
inviting, that two celestial nymphs had come down to bathe there. The
Rajah became enamoured of one of them, who condescended to allow of his
attachment to her; and she and her sister nymph used thenceforward to
have frequent interviews with him in that garden. On one of those
occasions they brought with them a male inhabitant of the heavenly
regions, to whom they introduced the Rajah; and between him and
Malecheren a strict friendship ensued; in consequence of which he
agreed, at the Rajah&rsquo;s earnest request, to carry him in disguise to see
the court of the divine Inder,&mdash;a favour never before granted to any
mortal. The Rajah returned from thence with new ideas of splendour and
magnificence, which he immediately adopted in regulating his court and
his retinue, and in beautifying his seat of government. By this means
Mahâbalipoor became soon celebrated beyond all the cities of the earth;
and on account of its magnificence having been brought to the gods
assembled at the court of Inder, their jealousy was so much excited at
it, that they sent orders to the God of the Sea to let loose his
billows, and overflow a place which impiously pretended to vie in
splendour with their celestial mansions. This <span class="pagenum">{174}</span> command he obeyed,
and the city was at once overflowed by that furious element, nor has it

I know not whether the following fable was invented to account for the

</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Agastya is recorded to have been very low in stature; and one day,
previously to the rectifying the too oblique posture of the earth,
walking with Veeshnu on the shore of the ocean, the insolent Deep asked
the God, who that dwarf was strutting by his side? Veeshnu replied, it
was the patriarch Agastya going to restore the earth to its true
balance. The sea, in utter contempt of his pigmy, form, dashed him with
his spray as he passed along; on, which the sage, greatly incensed at
the designed affront, <span class="pagenum">{177}</span> scooped up some of the water in the hollow
of his hand, and drank it off: he again and again repeated the draught,
nor desisted till he had drained the bed of the ocean of the entire
volume of its waters. Alarmed at this effect of his holy indignation,
and dreading an universal drought, the Devatas made intercession with
Agastya to relent from his anger, and again restore an element so
necessary to the existence of nature, both animate and inanimate.
Agastya, pacified, granted their request, and discharged the imbibed
fluid in a way becoming the histories of a gross physical people to
relate, but by no means proper for this page; away, however, that
evinced his sovereign power, while it marked his ineffable contempt for
the vain fury of an element, contending with a being armed with the
delegated power of the Creator of all things. After this miracle, the
earth being, by the same power, restored to its just balance, Agastya
and Veeshnu separated: when the latter, to prevent any similar accident
occurring, commanded the <i>great serpent</i> (that is, of the sphere) to
wind its enormous folds round the seven continents, of which, according
to Sanscreet geography, the earth consists, and appointed, as perpetual
guardians, to watch over and protect it, the eight powerful genii, so
renowned in the Hindoo system of mythology, as presiding over the eight

The residence of <i>Ixoru</i> is upon the silver mount <i>Calaja</i>, to the south
of the famous mountain <i>Mahameru</i>, being a most delicious place, planted
with all sorts of trees, that bear fruit all the year round. The roses
and other flowers send forth a most odoriferous scent; and the pond at
the foot of the mount is inclosed with pleasant walks of trees, that
afford an agreeable shade, whilst the peacocks and divers other birds
entertain the ear with their harmonious noise, as the beautiful women do
the eyes. The circumjacent woods are inhabited by a certain people <span class="pagenum">{179}</span>
called <i>Munis</i>, or <i>Rixis</i>, who, avoiding the conversation of others,
spend their time in offering daily sacrifices to their god.
</p>

<p>
It is observable, that though these pagans are generally black
themselves, they do represent these <i>Rixis</i> to be of a fair complexion,
with long white beards, and long garments hanging cross-ways, from about
the neck down over the breast. They are in such high esteem among them,
they believe that whom they bless are blessed, and whom they curse are
cursed.
</p>

<p>
Within the mountain lives another generation, called <i>Jexaquinnera</i> and
<i>Quendra</i>, who are free from all trouble, spend their days in continual
contemplations, praises, and prayers to God. Round about the mountain
stand seven ladders, by which you ascend to a spacious plain, in the
middle whereof is a bell of silver, and a square table, surrounded with
nine precious stones, of divers colours. Upon this table lies a silver
rose, called <i>Tamora Pua</i>, which contains two women as bright and fair
as a pearl: one is called <i>Brigasiri</i>, i. e. <i>the Lady of the Mouth;</i>
the other <i>Tarasiri</i>, i.e. <i>the Lady of the Tongue</i>,&mdash;because they
praise God with the mouth and tongue. In the centre of this rose is the

God.&mdash;<span class="sc">Baldæus</span>.

<i>The footless fowl of Heaven.</i>&mdash;XXI. p. 93.
</div>

<p>
There is a bird that falls down out of the air dead, and is found
sometimes in the Molucco Islands, that has no feet at all. The bigness
of her body and bill, as likewise the form of them, is much the same as
a swallow&rsquo;s; but the spreading out of her wings and tail has no less
compass than an eagle&rsquo;s. She lives and breeds in the air, comes not near
the earth but for her burial, for the largeness and lightness of her
wings and tail sustain her without lassitude. And the laying of her
eggs, and breeding of her young, is upon the back of the male, which is
made hollow, as also the breast of the female, for the more easy
incubation. Also two strings, like two shoemaker&rsquo;s ends, come from the
hinder parts of the male, wherewith it is conceived that he is fastened
closer to the female, while she hatches her eggs on the hollow of <span class="pagenum">{184}</span>
his back. The dew of heaven is appointed her for food, her region being
too far removed from the approach of flies and such like insects.
</p>

<p>
This is the entire story and philosophy of this miraculous bird in
<i>Cardan</i>, who professes himself to have seen it no less than thrice, and
to have described it accordingly. The contrivances whereof, if the
matter were certainly true, are as evident arguments of a Divine
Providence, as that copper-ring, with the Greek<sup><a href="#fn36b" id="fn36a">36</a></sup> inscription upon
it, was an undeniable monument of the artifice and finger of man.
</p>

<p>
But that the reproach of over-much credulity may not lie upon <i>Cardan</i>
alone, Scaliger, who lay at catch with him to take him tripping wherever
he could, cavils not with any thing in the whole narration but the
bigness of wings and the littleness of the body; which he undertakes to
correct from one of his own which was sent him by <i>Orvesanus</i> from Java.
Nay, he confirms what his antagonist has wrote, partly by history and
partly by reason; affirming, that himself, in his own garden, found two
<span class="pagenum">{185}</span> little birds with membranaceous wings utterly devoid of legs,
their form was near to that of a bat&rsquo;s. Nor is he deterred from the
belief of the perpetual flying of the <i>Manucodiata</i>, by the gaping of
the feathers of her wings, which seem thereby less fit to sustain her
body, but further makes the narration probable by what he has observed
in kites hovering in the air, as he saith, for a whole hour together
without flapping of her wings, or changing place. And he has found also
how she may sleep in the air, from the example of fishes, which he has
seen sleeping in the water without sinking themselves to the bottom, and
without changing place, but lying stock still, <i>pinnulis tantum nescia
quid motiuncule meditantes</i>, only wagging a little their fins, as
heedlessly and unconcernedly as horses while they are asleep wag their
ears to displace the flies that sit upon them. Wherever Scaliger
admitting that the Menucodiata is perpetually on the wing in the air, he
must of necessity admit also that manner of incubation that Cardan
describes, else how could their generations continue?
</p>

<p>
Franciscus Hernandeo affirms the same with Cardan expressly in every
thing: As also Eusebius Nierembergius, who is so taken with the story of
this bird, that he could not abstain from celebrating her miraculous
properties in a short but elegant copy of verses; and does <span class="pagenum">{186}</span> after,
though confidently opposed, assert the main matter again in prose.
</p>

<p>
Such are the sufferages of Cardan, Scaliger, Hernandeo, Nierembergius.
But Aldrovandus rejects that fable of her feeding on the dew of heaven,
and of her incubiture on the back of the male, with much scorn and
indignation. And as for the former, his reasons are no ways
contemptible, he alledging that dew is a body not perfectly enough
mixed, or heterogenial enough for food, nor the hard bill of the bird
made for such easie uses as sipping this soft moisture.
</p>

<p>
To which I know not what Cardan and the rest would answer, unless this,
that they mean by dew the more unctuous moisture of the air, which as it
may not be alike every where, so these birds may be fitted with a
natural sagacity to find it out where it is. That there is dew in this
sense day and night, (as well as in the morning,) and in all seasons of
the year; and therefore a constant supply of moisture and spirits to
their perpetual flying, which they more copiously imbibe by reason of
their exercise: That the thicker parts of this moisture stick and
convert into flesh, and that the lightness of their feathers is so
great, that their pains in sustaining themselves are not over-much. That
what is homogeneal and simple to our sight is fit enough to be the
rudiments of generation, <span class="pagenum">{187}</span> all animals being generated of a kind of
clear crystalline liquor; and that, therefore, it may be also of
nutrition; that orpine and sea-house-leek are nourished and grow, being
hung in the air, and that dock-weed has its root no deeper than near the
upper parts of the water; and, lastly, that the bills of these birds are
for their better flying, by cutting the way, and for better ornament;
for the rectifying also and composing of their feathers, while they swim
in the air with as much ease as swans do in river.
</p>

<p>
To his great impatiency against their manner of incubation, they would
happily return this answer: That the way is not ridiculous; but it may
be rather necessary from what Aldrovandus himself not only acknowledges
but contends for, namely, that they have no feet at all. For hence it is
manifest, that they cannot light upon the ground, nor any where rest on
their bellies, and be able to get on wing again, because they cannot
creep out of holes of rocks, as swifts and such like short-footed birds
can, they having no feet at all to creep with. Besides, as Aristotle
well argues concerning the long legs of certain water-fowl, that they
were made so long, because they were to wade in the water and catch
fish, adding that excellent aphorism, τὰ γαρ ὄργανα
πρὸς τὸ ἔργον ἡ φύσις ποιεῖ ἀλλ᾽ ὐ
τὸ ἔργον πρὸς τὰ ὄργανα, so may we rationally
conclude, will they say, that as the long legs of these water-fowl <span class="pagenum">{188}</span>
imply a design of their haunting the water, so want of legs in these
Manucodiatas argue they are never to come down to the earth, because
they can neither stand there nor get off again. And if they never come
on the earth, or any other resting-place, where can their eggs be laid
or hatched but on the back of the male?
</p>

<p>
Besides that Cardan pleases himself with that Antiphonie in nature, that
as the Ostrich being a bird, yet never flies in the air, and never rests
upon the earth. And as for Aldrovandus, his presumption from the five
several Manucodiatas that he had seen, and in which he could observe no
such figuration of parts as implied a fitness for such a manner of
incubation, Cardan will answer, Myself has seen three, and Scaliger one,
who both agree against you.
</p>

<p>
However, you see that both Cardan, Aldrovandus, and the rest do jointly
agree in allowing the Manucodiata no feet, as also in furnishing her
with two strings, hanging at the hinder parts of her body, which
Aldrovandus will have to be in the female as well as in the male, though
Cardan&rsquo;s experience reacheth not so far.
</p>

<p>
But Pighafetta and Clusius will easily end this grand controversy
betwixt Cardan and Aldrovandus, if it be true which they report, and if
they speak of the same kind of Birds of Paradise. For they both affirm
that they <span class="pagenum">{189}</span> have feet a palm long, and that with all confidence
imaginable; but Nierembergius on the contrary affirms, that one that was
an eye witness, and that had taken up one of these birds newly dead,
told him that it had no feet at all. Johnston also gives his suffrage
with Nierembergius in this, though with Aldrovandus he rejects the
manner of their incubation.
</p>

<p>
But unless they can raise themselves from the ground by the stiffness of
some of the feathers of their wings, or rather by virtue of those
nervous strings which they may have a power to stiffen when they are
alive, by transfusing spirits into them, and making them serve as well
instead of legs to raise them from the ground as to hang upon the boughs
of trees, by a slight thing being able to raise or hold up their
light-feathered bodies in the air, as a small twig will us in the water,
I should rather incline to the testimony of Pighafetta and Clusius than
to the judgment of the rest, and believe those mariners that told him
that the legs are pulled off by them that take them, and extenterate
them and dry them in the sun for either their private use or sale.
</p>

<p>
Which conclusion would the best solve the credit of Aristotle,
who long since has so peremptorily pronounced ὄτι πτηνὸν μόνον
ὐδὲν ἐσιν ὥσπερ νευσικὸν μόνον ἐσιν ὶχθὸς. That there is not any
bird that only flies as the fish only swims.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{190}</span></p>

<p>
But thus our Bird of Paradise is quite flown and vanished into a figment
or fable. But if any one will condole the loss of so convincing an
argument for a Providence that fits one thing to another, I must take
the freedom to tell him, that, unless he be a greater admirer of novelty
than a searcher into the indissoluble consequences of things, I shall
supply his meditation with what of this nature is as strongly
conclusive, and remind, that it will be his own reproach if he cannot
spy as clear an inference from an ordinary truth as from either an
uncertainty or a fiction. And in this regard, the bringing this doubtful
narration into play may not justly seem to no purpose, it carrying so
serious and castigatory a piece of pleasantry with it.
</p>

<p>
The manucodiata&rsquo;s living on the dew is no part of the convictiveness of
a Providence in this story: But the being excellently well provided of
wings and feathers, <i>tanta levitatis supellectile exornata</i>, as
Nierembergius speaks, being so well furnished with all advantages for
lightness, that it seems harder for her to sink down, as he conceits,
than to be borne up in the air; that a bird thus fitted for that region
should have no legs to stand on the earth, this would be a considerable
indication of a discriminating Providence, that on purpose avoids all
uselessness and superfluities.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{191}</span></p>

<p>
The other remarkable, and it is a notorious one, is the cavity on the
back of the male and in the breast of the female, for incubation; and
the third and last, the use of those strings, as Cardan supposes, for
the better keeping them together in incubiture.
</p>

<p>
If these considerations of this strange story strike so strongly upon
thee as to convince thee of a Providence, think it humour and not
judgment, if what I put in lieu of them, and is but ordinary, have not
the same force with thee.
</p>

<p>
For is not the fish&rsquo;s wanting feet, (as we observed before,) she being
sufficiently supplied with fins in so thick an element as the water, as
great an argument for a Providence as so light a bird&rsquo;s wanting feet in
that thinner element of the air, the extream lightness of her furniture
being appropriated to the thinness of that element? And is not the same
Providence seen, and that as conspicuously, in allotting but very short
legs to those birds that are called Apodeo both in Plinie and Aristotle,
upon whom she has bestowed such large and strong wings, and a power of
flying so long and swift, as in giving no legs at all to the
manucodiata, who has still a greater power of wing and lightness of
body?
</p>

<p>
And as for the cavities on the back of the male and in the breast of the
female, is that design of nature any more <span class="pagenum">{192}</span> certain and plain than
in the genital parts of the male and female in all kinds of animals?
What greater argument of counsel and purpose of fitting one thing for
another can there be than that? And if we should make a more inward
search into the contrivances of these parts in an ordinary hen, and
consider how or by what force an egg of so great a growth and bigness is
transmitted from the ovarium through the infundibulum into the processus
of the uterus, the membranes being go thin and the passage so very
small, to see to the principle of that motion cannot be thought less
than divine.
</p>

<p>
And if you would compare the protuberant paps of teats in the females of
beasts with that cavity in the breast of the she-manucodiata, whether of
them, think you, is the plainer pledge of a knowing and a designing
Providence?
</p>

<p>
And, lastly, for the strings that are conceived to hold together the
male and female in their incubiture, what a toy is it, if compared with
those invisible links and ties that engage ordinary birds to sit upon
their eggs, they having no visible allurement to such a tedious
service?&mdash;<span class="sc">Henry More</span>&rsquo;s <i>Antidote against Atheism</i>, book 2. ch. 11.

They who are acquainted with day and night know that the day of Brahma

proceed from invisibility to visibility; so, on the approach of night,
they are all dissolved away in that which is called invisible. The
universe, even, having existed, is again dissolved; and now again, on
the approach of day, by divine necessity, it is reproduced. That which,
upon the dissolution of all things else, is not destroyed, is superior
and of another nature from that visibility: it is invisible and eternal.

</p>

<p>
There is a story concerning Yamen which will remind the reader, in its
purport, of the fable of Love and Death.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{195}</span></p>

<p>
&ldquo;A famous penitent, <i>Morrugandumagarexi</i> by name, had, during a long
series of years, served the gods with uncommon and most exemplary piety.
This very virtuous man having no children, was extremely desirous of
having one, and therefore daily besought the god Xiven (or Seeva) to
grant him one. At length the god heard his desire, but, before he
indulged it him, he asked him, whether he would have several children,
who should be long-lived and wicked, or one virtuous and prudent, who
should die in his sixteenth year? The penitent chose the latter: his
wife conceived, and was happily delivered of the promised son, whom they
named Marcandem. The boy, like his father, zealously devoted himself to
the worship of Xiven; but as soon as he had attained his sixteenth year,
the officers of Yhamen, god of death, were sent on the earth, to remove
him from thence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Young Marcandem being informed on what errand they were come, told
them, with a resolute air, that he was resolved not to die, and that
they might go back, if they pleased. They returned to their master, and
told him the whole affair. Yhamen immediately mounted his great buffle,
and set out. Being come, he told the youth that he acted very rashly in
refusing to leave the world, and it was unjust in him, for Xiven had
promised him a life only of sixteen years, and the term was expired. But
<span class="pagenum">{196}</span> this reason did not satisfy Marcandem, who persisted in his
resolution not to die; and, fearing lest the god of death should attempt
to take him away by force, he ran to his oratory, and taking the Lingam,
clasped it to his breast. Mean time Yhamen came down from his buffle,
threw a rope about the youth&rsquo;s neck, and held him fast therewith, as
also the Lingam, which Marcandem grasped with all his strength, and was
going to drag them both into hell, when Xiven issued out of the Lingam,
drove back the king of the dead, and gave him so furious a blow, that he
killed him on the spot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The god of death being thus slain, mankind multiplied so that the earth
was no longer able to contain them. The gods represented this to Xiven,
and he, at their entreaty, restored Yhamen to life, and to all the power
he had before enjoyed. Yhamen immediately dispatched a herald to all
parts of the world, to summon all the old men. The herald got drunk
before he set out, and, without staying till the fumes of the wine were
dispelled, mounted an elephant, and rode up and down the world, pursuant
to his commission; and, instead of publishing this order, he declared,
that it was the will and pleasure of Yamen, that, from this day forward,
all the leaves, fruits, and flowers, whether ripe or green, should fall
to the ground. This proclamation was no sooner <span class="pagenum">{197}</span> issued than men
began to yield to death: But before Yhamen was killed, only the old were
deprived of life, and now people of all ages are summoned
indiscriminately.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Picart</span>.

What is this to the coming of Seeva, as given us by Mr. Maurice, from
the Seeva Paurana?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the place of the right wheel blazed the Sun, in the place of the
left was the Moon; instead of the brazen nails and bolts, which firmly
held the ponderous wheels, were distributed Bramans on the right hand,
and Reyshees on the left; in lieu of the canopy on the top of the
chariot was overspread the vault of Heaven; the counterpoise of the
wheels was on the east and west, and the four Semordres were instead of
the cushions and bolsters; the four Vedas were placed as the horses of
the chariot, and Saraswaty was for the bell; the piece of wood by which
the horses are driven was the three-lettered Mantra, while Brama himself
was the charioteer, and the Nacshatras and stars were distributed about
it by way of ornaments. Sumaru was in the place of a bow, the serpent
Seschanaga was stationed as the string, Veeshnu instead of an arrow, and
fire was constituted its point. Ganges and other rivers were appointed
its precursors; and the setting out of the chariot, with its appendages
and furniture, one would affirm to be the year of twelve months
gracefully moving forwards.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When Seeva, with his numerous troops and prodigious <span class="pagenum">{200}</span> army, was
mounted, Brama drove so furiously, that thought itself, which, in its
rapid career, compasses Heaven and Earth, could not keep pace with it.
By the motion of the chariot Heaven and Earth were put into a tremor;
and, as the Earth was not able to bear up under this burthen, the Cow of
the Earth, Kam-deva, took upon itself to support the weight. Seeva went
with intention to destroy Treepoor; and the multitude of Devatas and
Reyshees and Apsaras who waited on his stirrup, opening their mouths, in
transports of joy and praise, exclaimed, Jaya! Jaya! so that Parvati,
not being able to bear his absence, set out to accompany Seeva, and, in
an instant, was up with him; while the light which brightened on his
countenance, on the arrival of Parvati, surpassed all imagination and
description. The Genii of the eight regions, armed with all kinds of
weapons, but particularly with <i>agnyastra</i>, or fire-darts, like moving
mountains, advanced in front of the army; and Eendra and other Devetas,
some of them mounted on elephants, some on horses, others on chariots,
or on camels or buffaloes, were stationed on each side, while all the
other order of Devetas, to the amount of some lacs, formed the centre.
The Munietuvaras, with long hair on their heads, like Saniassis, holding
their staves in their hands, danced as they went along; the Syddhyas,
who revolve about <span class="pagenum">{201}</span> the heavens, opening their mouths in praise of
Seeva, rained flowers upon his head; and the vaulted heaven, which is
like an inverted goblet, being appointed in the place of a drum, exalted

<p>
Mr Wilkins has given the genuine history of this liquor, which was
produced by churning the sea with a mountain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is a fair and stately mountain, and its name is <i>Meroo</i>, a most
exalted mass of glory, reflecting the sunny <span class="pagenum">{203}</span> rays from the splendid
surface of its gilded horns. It is clothed in gold, and is the
respected haunt of <i>Dews</i> and <i>Gandharvas</i>. It is inconceivable, and not
to be encompassed by sinful man; and it is guarded by dreadful serpents.
Many celestial medicinal plants adorn its sides; and it stands, piercing
the heaven with its aspiring summit, a mighty hill, inaccessible even by
the human mind. It is adorned with trees and pleasant streams, and
resoundeth with the delightful songs of various birds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The <i>Soors</i>, and all the glorious hosts of heaven, having ascended to
the summit of this lofty mountain, sparkling with precious gems, and for
eternal ages raised, were sitting in solemn synod, meditating the
discovery of the <i>Amreeta</i>, the Water of Immortality. The <i>Dew Narayan</i>
being also there, spoke unto <i>Brahma</i>, whilst the <i>Soors</i> were thus
consulting together, and said, &lsquo;Let the Ocean, as a pot of milk, be
churned by the united labour of the <i>Soors</i> and <i>Asoors</i>; and when the
mighty waters have been stirred up, the <i>Amreeta</i> shall be found. Let
them collect together every medicinal herb, and every precious thing,
and let them stir the Ocean, and they shall discover the <i>Amreeta</i>.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is also another mighty mountain, whose name is <i>Mandar</i>, and its
rocky summits are like towering <span class="pagenum">{204}</span> clouds. It is clothed in a net of
the entangled tendrils of the twining creeper, and resoundeth with the
harmony of various birds. Innumerable savage beasts infest its borders;
and it is the respected haunt of <i>Kennars</i>, <i>Dews</i>, and <i>Apsars</i>. It
standeth eleven thousand <i>Yojan</i> above the earth, and eleven thousand
more below its surface.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As the united bands of <i>Dews</i> were unable to remove this mountain, they
went before <i>Veeshnoo</i>, who was sitting with <i>Brahma</i>, and addressed
them in these words: &lsquo;Exert, O masters! your most superior wisdom to
remove the mountain <i>Mandar</i>, and employ your utmost power for our
good.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Veeshnoo</i> and <i>Brahma</i> having said, &lsquo;it shall be according to your
wish,&rsquo; he with the lotus eye directed the King of Serpents to appear;
and Ananta arose, and was instructed in that work by Brahma, and
commanded by <i>Narayan</i> to perform it. Then <i>Ananta</i>, by his power, took up
that king of mountains, together with all its forests and every
inhabitant thereof; and the <i>Soors</i> accompanied him into the presence of
the Ocean, whom they addressed, saying, &lsquo;We will stir up thy waters to
obtain the <i>Amreeta</i>,&rsquo; And the Lord of the Waters replied, &lsquo;Let me also
have a share, seeing I am to bear the violent agitation that will be
caused by the whirling of the <span class="pagenum">{205}</span> mountain!&rsquo; Then the <i>Soors</i> and
<i>Asoors</i> spoke unto <i>Koorna-raj</i>, the King of the Tortoises, upon the
strand of the Ocean, and said, &lsquo;My lord is able to be the supporter of
this mountain.&rsquo; The Tortoise replied, &lsquo;Be it so;&rsquo; and it was placed upon
his back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So the mountain being set upon the back of the Tortoise, <i>Eendra</i> began
to whirl it about as it were a machine. The mountain <i>Mandar</i> served as
a churn, and the serpent <i>Vasoakee</i> for the rope; and thus in former
days did the <i>Dews</i>, and <i>Asoors</i>, and the <i>Danoos</i>, begin to stir up
the waters of the ocean for the discovery of the <i>Amreeta</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The mighty <i>Asoors</i> were employed on the side of the serpent&rsquo;s head,
whilst all the <i>Soors</i> assembled about his tail. <i>Ananta</i>, that sovereign
<i>Dew</i>, stood near <i>Narayan</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They now pull forth the serpent&rsquo;s head repeatedly, and as often let it
go; whilst there issued from his mouth, thus violently drawing to and
fro by the <i>Soors</i> and <i>Asoors</i>, a continual stream of fire and smoke
and wind, which ascending in thick clouds, replete with lightning, it
began to rain down upon the heavenly bands, who were already fatigued
with their labour; whilst a shower of flowers was shaken from the top of
the mountain, covering the heads of all, both <i>Soors</i> and <span class="pagenum">{206}</span>
<i>Asoors</i>. In the mean time the roaring of the ocean, whilst violently
agitated with the whirling of the mountain <i>Mandar</i> by the <i>Soors</i> and
<i>Asoors</i>, was like the bellowing of a mighty cloud. Thousands of the
various productions of the waters were torn to pieces by the mountain,
and confounded with the briny flood; and every specific being of the
deep, and all the inhabitants of the great abyss which is below the
earth, were annihilated; whilst, from the violent agitation of the
mountain, the forest trees were dashed against each other, and
precipitated from its utmost height, with all the birds thereon; from
whose violent confrication a raging fire was produced, involving the
whole mountain with smoke and flame, as with a dark-blue cloud, and the
lightning&rsquo;s vivid flash. The lion and the retreating elephant are
overtaken by the devouring flames, and every vital being, and every
specific thing, are consumed in the general conflagration.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The raging flames, thus spreading destruction on all sides, were at
length quenched by a shower of cloud-borne water, poured down by the
immortal Eendra. And now a heterogeneous stream of the concocted juices
of various trees and plants ran down into the briny flood.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was from this milk-like stream of juices, produced <span class="pagenum">{207}</span> from those
trees and plants and a mixture of melted gold, that the <i>Soors</i> obtained
their immortality.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The waters of the Ocean now being assimilated with those juices, were
converted into milk, and from that milk a kind of butter was presently
produced; when the heavenly bands went again into the presence of
<i>Brahma</i>, the granter of boons, and addressed him, saying, &lsquo;Except
<i>Narayan</i>, every other <i>Soor</i> and <i>Asoor</i> is fatigued with his labour,
and still the <i>Amreeta</i> doth not appear; wherefore the churning of the
Ocean is at a stand.&rsquo; Then <i>Brahma</i> said unto <i>Narayan</i>, &lsquo;Endue them
with recruited strength, for thou art their support.&rsquo; And <i>Narayan</i>
answered and said, &lsquo;I will give fresh vigour to such as co-operate in
the work. Let <i>Mandar</i> be whirled about, and the bed of the ocean be
kept steady.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When they heard the words of <i>Narayan</i>, they all returned again to the
work, and began to stir about with great force that butter of the ocean,
when there presently arose from out the troubled deep, first the Moon,
with a pleasing countenance, shining with ten thousand beams of gentle
light; next followed <i>Sree</i>, the goddess of fortune, whose seat is the
white lily of the waters; then <i>Soora-Devee</i>, the goddess of wine, and
the white horse called <i>Oochisrava</i>. And after these there was produced
from the unctuous mass the jewel <i>Kowstoobh</i>, that glorious <span class="pagenum">{208}</span>
sparkling gem worn by Narayan on his breast; also <i>Pareejat</i>, the tree
of plenty, and <i>Soorabhee</i>, the cow that granted every heart&rsquo;s desire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The moon, <i>Soora-Devee</i>, the goddess of <i>Sree</i>, and the Horse, as swift
as thought, instantly marched away towards the <i>Dews</i>, keeping in the
path of the Sun.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then the <i>Dew Dhanwantaree</i>, in human shape, came forth, holding in his
hand a white vessel filled with the immortal juice <i>Amreeta</i>. When the
<i>Asoors</i> beheld these wondrous things appear, they raised their
tumultuous voices for the <i>Amreeta</i>, and each of them clamorously
exclaimed, &lsquo;This of right is mine.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the mean time <i>Travat</i>, a mighty elephant, arose, now kept by the
god of thunder; and as they continued to churn the ocean more than
enough, that deadly poison issued from its bed, burning like a raging
fire, whose dreadful fumes in a moment spread throughout the world,
confounding the three regions of the universe with the mortal stench,
until <i>Seev</i>, at the word of <i>Brahma</i>, swallowed the fatal drug, to save
mankind; which, remaining in the throat of that sovereign <i>Dew</i> of magic
form, from that time he hath been called <i>Neel-Kant</i>, because his throat
was stained blue.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When the <i>Asoors</i> beheld this miraculous deed, they <span class="pagenum">{209}</span> became
desperate, and the <i>Amreeta</i> and the goddess <i>Sree</i> became the source of
endless hatred.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then <i>Narayan</i> assumed the character and person of <i>Moheenee Maya</i>, the
power of enchantment, in a female form of wonderful beauty, and stood
before the <i>Asoors</i>, whose minds being fascinated by her presence, and
deprived of reason, they seized the <i>Amreeta</i>, and gave it unto her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The <i>Asoors</i> now clothe themselves in costly armour, and, seizing their
various weapons, rush on together to attack the <i>Soors</i>. In the mean
time <i>Narayan</i>, in the female form, having obtained the <i>Amreeta</i> from
the hands of their leader, the hosts of <i>Soors</i>, during the tumult and
confusion of the <i>Asoors</i>, drank of the living water.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it so fell out, that whilst the <i>Soors</i> were quenching their thirst
for immortality, <i>Rahoo</i>, an <i>Asoor</i>, assumed the form of a <i>Soor</i>, and
began to drink also: And the water had but reached his throat, when the
Sun and Moon, in friendship to the <i>Soors</i>, discovered the deceit; and
instantly <i>Narayan</i> cut off his head as he was drinking, with his
splendid weapon <i>Chakra</i>. And the gigantic head of the <i>Asoor</i>, emblem
of a mountain&rsquo;s summit, being thus separated from his body by the
<i>Chakra&rsquo;s</i> edge, bounded into the heavens with a dreadful cry, whilst
his ponderous trunk fell, cleaving the ground asunder, and <span class="pagenum">{210}</span> shaking
the whole earth unto its foundation, with all its islands, rocks, and
forests: And from that time the head of Rahoo resolved an eternal
enmity, and continueth, even unto this day, at times to seize upon the
Sun and Moon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now Narayan, having quitted the female figure he had assumed, began to
disturb the <i>Asoors</i> with sundry celestial weapons: and from that
instant a dreadful battle was commenced, on the ocean&rsquo;s briny strand,
between the <i>Asoors</i> and the <i>Soors</i>. Innumerable sharp and missile
weapons were hurled, and thousands of piercing darts and battle-axes
fell on all sides. The <i>Asoors</i> vomit blood from the wounds of the
<i>Chakra</i>, and fall upon the ground pierced by the sword, the spear, and
spiked club. Heads, glittering with polished gold, divided by the
<i>Pattees&rsquo;</i> blade, drop incessantly; and mangled bodies, wallowing in
their gore, lay like fragments of mighty rocks, sparkling with gems and
precious ores. Millions of sighs and groans arise on every side; and the
sun is overcast with blood, as they clash their arms, and wound each
other with their dreadful instruments of destruction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now the battle is fought with the iron-spiked club, and, as they close,
with clenched fist; and the din of war ascendeth to the heavens. They
cry &lsquo;Pursue! <span class="pagenum">{211}</span> strike! fell to the ground!&rsquo; so that a horrid and
tumultuous noise is heard on all sides.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the midst of this dreadful hurry and confusion of the fight, <i>Nar</i>
and <i>Narayan</i> entered the field together. <i>Narayan</i>, beholding a
celestial bow in the hand of <i>Nar</i>, it reminded him of his <i>Chakra</i>, the
destroyer of the <i>Asoors</i>. The faithful weapon, by name <i>Soodarsan</i>,
ready at the mind&rsquo;s call, flew down from heaven with direct and
refulgent speed, beautiful, yet terrible to behold: And being arrived,
glowing like the sacrificial flame, and spreading terror around,
<i>Narayan</i>, with his right arm formed like the elephantine trunk, hurled
forth the ponderous orb, the speedy messenger and glorious ruin of
hostile towns; who, raging like the final all-destroying fire, shot
bounding with desolating force, killing thousands of the <i>Asoors</i> in his
rapid flight, burning and involving, like the lambent flame, and cutting
down all that would oppose him. Anon he climbeth the heavens, and now
again darteth into the field like a <i>Peesach</i>, to feast in blood.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now the dauntless <i>Asoors</i> strive, with repeated strength, to crush the
<i>Soors</i> with rocks and mountains, which, hurled in vast numbers into the
heavens, appeared like scattered clouds, and fell, with all the trees
thereon, in millions of fear-exciting torrents, striking <span class="pagenum">{212}</span> violently
against each other with a mighty noise; and in their fall the earth,
with all its fields and forests, is driven from its foundation: they
thunder furiously at each other as they roll along the field, and spend
their strength in mutual conflict.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now <i>Nar</i>, seeing the <i>Soors</i> overwhelmed with fear, filled up the path
to Heaven with showers of golden-headed arrows, and split the mountain
summits with his unerring shafts; and the <i>Asoors</i> finding themselves
again sore pressed by the <i>Soors</i>, precipitately flee; some rush
headlong into the briny waters of the ocean, and others hide themselves
within the bowels of the earth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The rage of the glorious <i>Chakra</i>, <i>Soodarsan</i>, which for a while burnt
like the oil-fed fire, now grew cool, and he retired into the heavens
from whence he came. And the <i>Soors</i> having obtained the victory, the
mountain <i>Mandar</i> was carried back to its former station with great
respect, whilst the waters also retired, filling the firmament and the
heavens with their dreadful roarings.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The <i>Soors</i> guarded the <i>Amreeta</i> with great care, and rejoiced
exceedingly because of their success. And <i>Eendra</i>, with all his
immortal bands, gave the water of life into <i>Narayan</i>, to keep it for
their use.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Mahabharat</span>.
</p>

<p>
Amrita, or Immortal, is, according to Sir William <span class="pagenum">{213}</span> Jones, the name
which the mythologists of Tibet apply to a celestial tree, bearing
ambrosial fruit, and adjoining to four vast rocks, from which as many
sacred rivers derive their several streams.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
